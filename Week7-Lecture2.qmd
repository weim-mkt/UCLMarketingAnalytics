## What is Marketing Mix Modeling

::: block
### Marketing Mix Modeling

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is the use of statistical analysis to **estimate the causal impact** of various marketing **mix variables (especially pricing and promotions)** on **sales**.
:::

-   **Core idea**: find an appropriate statistical model that can characterize the relationship (DGP) between sales and marketing mix variables

## Phase 1: Data Collection (What to Include in a MMM Model?)

![](images/class8_WhatToInclude.png){fig-align="center"}

## Phase 2: Statistical Modelling

-   What functional forms and specifications to use for each variable?
    -   More of an art than science

    -   quadratic terms when [diminishing return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp)s are expected

-   How to determine the "best" model
    -   predictive accuracy (error of predicted sales)

    -   model fit ($R^2$)

## Classic Examples of MMM

**Example 1**: Model the relationship between **sales** and **price** as follows:

$$
sales_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1Price_t + X_t\beta+ \epsilon_t
$$

**Example 2**: Model the relationship between **sales** and **number of influencers** as follows.

-   We would normally consider diminishing marginal return of marketing activities

$$
sales_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1NumInflu + \beta_2NumInflu^2 + X_t\beta+ \epsilon_t
$$

## Phase 3: Model-Based Optimization

The outputs from your MMM project -- that is, the data and estimates that comes out of your statistical model -- needs to address the profit maximization problem.

-   The MMM model will produce a host of outputs that measure how each tactic (e.g., price) affects sales.
-   We can then use the outputs to guide our marketing decisions.

## Optimal Pricing to Maximize Profit

-   We can utilize the outputs to compute the optimal pricing

$$
sales_t = 1000 - 20 Price_t + X_t\beta+ \epsilon_t
$$

-   Then we know, conditional on $X_t$, the total revenue would be

$$
profit = (Price - COGS) *sales = (Price - COGS)*(1000 + X_t\beta - 20*Price)
$$

-   We can derive the optimal price to maximize profit.

$$
\partial profit/\partial price = (1000 + X_t\beta - 20 Price) - 20 (Price - COGS) = 0
$$

-   The optimal price that can maximize the revenue/profit is $\frac{1000 + X_t\beta+20COGS}{40}$

- In term 2's Operations Analytics module, you will systematically learn how to find the optimal pricing, given the estimated functional relationship between sales and marketing mix variables.
