## Customer Acquisition Cost

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Definition

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** is the cost of converting a customer to purchase a product/service.
:::

-   Why should we care about CAC? Having a new customer may not always be a good thing. For example, no company would spend £500 to acquire a new customer worth £300

## Customer Acquisition Cost: Calculation

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

When the marketing cost can be attributed to each individual customer

-   CAC = (# of offers needed to acquire 1 customer) \* (cost of making a marketing offer)
-   CAC = (cost of making a marketing offer) / (customer response rate)
:::

-   After we study predictive analytics later in this module, we will be able to predict response rate for each individual customer and compute individual-specific CAC.

## Customer Acquisition Cost: An Example

A new Bubble Tea shop in Canary Wharf is contemplating whether or not to attract new customers by sending ads leaflets to nearby residents.

The cost of sending a leaflet, which includes production and labor costs, is **£0.5**.

1.  randomly sending out leaflets
    -   expected response rate of **1%**
2.  using names purchased from a marketing agency
    -   each name costs **£0.2**
    -   expected response rate of **4%** by analyzing the buying behavior and demographics of current customers

Compute the CAC for each choice.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
cost_per_random_offer <- 0.5
response_rate_random_offer <- 0.01
# Following the formula in the previous slide
CAC_random_offer <- cost_per_random_offer / response_rate_random_offer
CAC_random_offer
```

```{r}
cost_per_targeted_offer <- 0.5 + 0.2 
response_rate_targeted_offer <- 0.04
CAC_targeted_offer <- cost_per_targeted_offer/response_rate_targeted_offer
CAC_targeted_offer
```

# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)


## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

Customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV) is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of their relationship.
:::

-   The underlying idea of CLV is essentially NPV, but at the customer level.
    -   Think of acquiring a new customer as an investment in an "asset" that can generate future cash flows

## CLV: Calculation

$$
\mathrm{CLV} = - CAC + \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{CF_t * r^{(t-1)}}{(1+k)^{t}},
where \space CF_t = M_t - c_t
$$

-   $r$ is the average annual retention rate; $r^{(t-1)}$ is the cumulative retention rate in year $t$
-   $N$ is the number of years over which the relationship is calculated
-   $M_{t}$ is the margin the customer generates in year $t$
-   $c_{t}$ is the expected cost of marketing communications or promotions targeted to the customer in year $t$
-   $k$ is the rate for discounting future cash flows. The discount factor $d = 1/(1+k)$.

## Retention Rate

-  The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or rate of customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with the company.

        -   retention rate = 1 - churn rate

        -   **How to compute *individual* churn rate**: machine learning models to predict the churn rate of an individual customer (Week 4)

## Number of Years of Customer Relationship

-   If we assume **infinite** customer economic life, we can simplify the formula into the following using the property of geometric sequence.

$$
C L V_{N} = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{g r^{(t-1)}}{(1+k)^{t}} => C L V_{N}=\mathrm{g} \cdot \frac{1-\left(\frac{r}{1+k}\right)^{N}}{1+k-r}  => 
C L V_{\infty}=\frac{g}{(1+k-r)}
$$

-   However, most of the time, we are more comfortable to assume **finite** customer economic life; we need to decide on a cutoff date for CLV calculation
    -   Rule A: until the year when the $g = M-c$ becomes negative
    -   Rule B: industry's average customer lifespan

## Overview for Computing CLV

![](images/CLV%20i-basket.png){fig-align="left" width="400"}

## Step 1: Determine time unit of analysis

-   Time unit of analysis
    
    -   *\[...\] (find info in the case study)*

        -   When should we use monthly analysis or other units of time?

## Step 2: Determine number of years

-   $N$: the number of years over which the customer relationship is assessed
    -   *\[...\] (find info in the case study)*
    -   How can you do better here?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
N <-
```
    
## Step 3: Compute CF for each period
    
$CF = M - c$: **gross profit each year, which is the profit from sales M minus marketing costs c**
    
-   *most customers paid the \$99 annual membership fee*
    
\footnotesize
    
```{r}
    #| eval: false
    membership <-
```
    
## Step 3: Compute CF for each period
    
-   *40 times each year; each time \$100; with profit margin 7% (COGS 93%)*
    
\footnotesize
    
```{r}
#| eval: false

    n_visit <-
    revenue_each_visit <-
    profit_margin <-
    ## think carefully about how M is calculated, it's tricky ~~~~
    M <-
```
    
\normalsize
    
-   *variable delivery costs each order:*
        -   *\[...\] find info in the case study about delivery costs*
        -   Why classified as variable marketing costs? Does it make a difference?
    
\footnotesize
    
```{r}
    #| eval: false
    deliverycost_each_visit <-
    c <- deliverycost_each_visit * n_visit
```

## Step 3: Compute CF for each period

-   The annual CF from customers CF

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# CF is the cash flow for one year
CF <-
    # create a sequence of CF for N years
    profit_seq <- rep(CF, N)

```

## Step 4: Compute sequence of retention rate

4.  $r$: retention rate

-   *\[...\] (find info in the case study)*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# retention_rate is the probability of customer staying with us after 1 year
retention_rate <-
    # create a geometric sequence of accumulative retention rate for N years
retention_seq <-
```
    
## Step 5: Compute sequence of discount factors
    
5.  $k$: the discount rate
    
-   *\[...\] A yearly discount rate of 10%*
    
\footnotesize
    
```{r}
    #| eval: false
    discount_rate <- 0.1
discount_factor_seq <-
```
    
\normalsize
    
-   *\[...\] The team decided to take a conservative approach whereby all profits are booked at the end of year*.
        -   All profits earned per customer in year 1 need to be discounted once, the profits earned in year 2 need to be discounted twice, and so on
    
## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs
    
6.  What does the CAC include in the case study?
    
*\[...\] (find info in the case study)*
    
::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}

## Marketing Funnel for Paid Search Ads

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Marketing Funnels

A marketing funnel is a model that represents the customer's journey from the initial awareness of a product or service to the ultimate action, often a purchase. This journey is depicted as a funnel to illustrate the decrease in the number of potential customers at each stage--Awareness, Interest, Consideration, Intent, Evaluation, and Purchase - each representing a different stage in the customer's journey toward transaction.

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

**CAC Part I: Costs of paid search ads to get 1 new member.**

-   \[...\] *The click-through rates varied across these digital platforms, but hovered around 1-2%.*

-   How to incorporate this information?

-   \[...\] *a fifth of those who clicked on an ad were willing to give the service a try*

-   How many clickers do we need for 1 new "trier"?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# clicker_to_trier_rate is the % of trier customers from clickers
clicker_to_trier_rate <-
```

\normalsize

-   *\[...\] 20% of those that signed up for the free trial ended up becoming members*
-   How many triers do we need for1 new member?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# trier_to_member_rate is the % of a new member from triers
trier_to_member_rate <-
```

\normalsize

::: {.content-visible when-format="beamer"}
## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs
:::

-   How many clickers do we need for 1 new member?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
n_clickers_for_1newmember <- (1 / clicker_to_trier_rate) * (1 / trier_to_member_rate) # 5 * 5 = 25
```

\normalsize

-   Finally, based on the the cost per click information, we can compute the total click costs to get 1 member.

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
total_cost_clicks <- 0.4 * n_clickers_for_1newmember # 0.4 * 25
```

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

**CAC Part II: total costs of \$15 promo for first order each trier customer**

-   What is the total promo cost for these "trier" customers' first order?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
promo_first_order_each_trier <- 15

total_cost_promo <- promo_first_order_each_trier * # promotion amount = $15
(1 - profit_margin) * # 7% profit margin
(1 / trier_to_member_rate) # num of triers = 5

```

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

**CAC Part III: total costs from selling groceries**

-   For each trier, 2 visits , the profits from the 2 visits are:

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_each_trier <- revenue_each_visit * # $100 per visit
    profit_margin * # 7% profit margin
    2 # a trier shops twice
```

\normalsize

-   For each trier, the 2 visits are free of delivery charges, which are marketing costs to i-basket

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
deliverycost_1st <- 5 + (revenue_each_visit + promo_first_order_each_trier) * 0.035
deliverycost_2nd <- 5 + revenue_each_visit * 0.035
deliverycost_each_trier <- deliverycost_1st + deliverycost_2nd
```

\normalsize

-   For each trier, compute net marketing costs from the 2 visits (marketing costs - earned profits)

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
netcost_each_trier <- deliverycost_each_trier - profit_each_trier
```

\normalsize

-   Total net profits from all 25 triers

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
totalcosts_from_all_triers <- netcost_each_trier * (1 / trier_to_member_rate)
```

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

6.  CAC = total costs for customer ad clicks (for all clickers) + total costs of \$15 promo (for all triers) + total costs of selling groceries (for all triers)

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
CAC <- total_cost_clicks + total_cost_promo + totalcosts_from_all_triers
```

## Step 7: Compute CLV

7.  Compute the CLV based on the CLV formula (Table A)

-   7.1 Revenues, variables costs, and profit for the next 5 years

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_seq
```

\normalsize

-   7.2 Apply retention rate

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_seq_after_churn <- profit_seq *
    ```
    
    \normalsize
    
    -   7.3 Apply discount factor
    
    \footnotesize
    
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    profit_seq_after_churn_discount <- profit_seq_after_churn *
    ```
    
    \normalsize
    
    -   7.4 Compute CLV by summing up future expected profits
    
    \footnotesize
    
    ```{r}
    #| eval: false
    CLV <- sum(profit_seq_after_churn_discount) - CAC
```

**We can use CLV as the key managerial tool for evaluating different marketing initiatives!**

## User Defined Functions in R

A **User Defined Function** (UDF) in R refers to a function created by the user, as opposed to built-in functions, to perform specific operations or actions. UDFs are useful for automating and coding specific tasks that aren't covered by R's rich set of built-in functions, allowing the user to specify exactly what the function should do.

1.  **Function Name**: The user decides the name of the function.

2.  **Function Body**: Contains the code that performs the operation.

3.  **Arguments**: (Optional) Values that can be passed into the function to influence its behavior.

4.  **Return Value**: What the function outputs after it is called and executed.

## Syntax of UDF

```{r}
#| eval: false
function_name <- function(arg1, arg2, ...) {
    # Code to perform operations

    return(output)
}
```

## Use UDF to Compute CLV and Guide Marketing Decisions

1.  (To guide customer acquisition) What if the company only offers \$5 for first time purchase? This will save some CAC but the cliker-to-trier rate will decrease to 10%. Please compute the new CLV. Should you go ahead with the proposed change?

2.  (To guide customer retention) What if the company increases the annual membership fee to \$119? This will increase revenue from memberships but will also make some customers unhappy so their retention rate reduce to 60%. Please compute the new CLV. Should you go ahead with the proposed change? What if the retention rate reduces to 50%?

3.  (To conduct sensitivity analysis; after-class) Due to post-COVID economic recession, new members' spending is uncertain: there is a 60% chance of \$30 revenue per visit, 30% chance of \$40 revenue per visit, and 10% chance of \$50 revenue per visit. What would be the expected CLV for a new member customer?
