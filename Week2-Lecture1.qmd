# Recap of BEA

## Objective of Marketing Process

```{r}

```

![](images/marketingprocess.png){fig-align="center" width="433"}

-   Marketing activities need to create value for the company

## Break-Even Analyses

-   Any marketing activity (in fact, any business activity)

    -   incurs some marketing expense/investment costs

    -   generates benefits for the company (e.g., incremental sales; higher customer retention rate)

-   The core idea of a break-even analysis is to compare the benefit with the cost

    -   BEA is sometimes called cost-benefit analysis.

## Break-Even Quantity

-   For a marketing campaign with **fixed marketing expenditure** with **short-term impacts**, we can compute **BEQ** to evaluate its feasibility
-   **BEQ** calculates the number of **incremental** units the firm needs to sell to cover the cost of the marketing campaign.
    -   Incremental because we are comparing with status quo

## Break-Even Quantity Formula

-   [Contribution Margin Per Unit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contributionmargin.asp) = Price Per Unit - Variable Costs Per Unit

    -   Measures how much money each additional sale "contributes" to the company's total profits.

    -   **contribution margin rate**[^1] = contribution margin per unit / price per unit

[^1]: It's important to **infer** percentage/absolute terms from the context.

<!-- -->

-   Break-Even Quantity = Marketing Expenditure / Contribution Margin Per Unit

-   Compare BEQ with estimated **incremental** sales to finish break-even analyses

    -   Marketing costs are usually easy to obtain through budgeting
    -   Incremental sales will need to be estimated through causal inference tools (i.e., the causal impact of influencer marketing on sales)

-   If the estimated incremental sales can exceed BEQ, approve the marketing campaign

## PineApple BEQ

-   Assign values to R objects based on case background information

\footnotesize

```{r}
price <- 600 # retail price
quantity <- 10 # sales; it's 10 million, bear this unit in mind
COGS <- 0.6 # cost of goods sold in percentage terms
RD_costs <- 100 # R&D Costs
endorsement_fee <- 50 # fixed marketing expenditure
```

\normalsize

-   `quantity` is 10 million; we use 10 for brevity
    -   **Sales** refers to **quantity sales** by industry practice
    -   **Revenue** or **revenue sales** refers to monetary sales
-   [`COGS`](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp) is the variable costs per unit in the BEQ formula
    -   Used in both percentage or value terms interchangeably.
-   R&D costs are [sunk costs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sunkcost.asp)
    -   Should sunk costs be considered in a BEA for a marketing campaign?

## PineApple BEQ Step 1

-   Compute the contribution margin per unit

\footnotesize

```{r}
# Following the definition
# contribution margin per unit = price - variable cost
contribution_margin_per_unit <- price - price * COGS
contribution_margin_per_unit

# equivalently, contribution margin rate = 1 - COGS
# contribution margin per unit = price * contribution margin rate  
contribution_margin_per_unit <- price * (1 - COGS) 
contribution_margin_per_unit
```

## PineApple BEQ Step 2

-   Compute the break-even quantity

\footnotesize

```{r}
# numerator is the marketing expense
# denominator is the the contribution margin per unit

BEQ <- endorsement_fee / contribution_margin_per_unit
BEQ
```

\normalsize

-   The marketing costs, i.e., the endorsement fee, is `r endorsement_fee` million pounds

-   Each incremental sale makes profit by `r contribution_margin_per_unit` pounds

    =\> This means, the influencer marketing campaign needs to increase sales by at least BEQ (`r BEQ` million) units, in order for the company not to lose any money

## PineApple BEQ Step 3

-   Compare BEQ with estimated **incremental** sales to finish break-even analyses
-   In the case study, "the team estimates that such an influencer campaign can increase the total sales within the next financial year by 2.5%."
    -   The comparison base is the original estimated sales without any marketing campaign, so the incremental units of sales would be `quantity * 0.025`

\footnotesize

```{r}
quantity * 0.025 
```

\normalsize

-   We need to sell `` `r BEQ` `` million units to break-even (not earn or lose money), but we can in fact sell `r quantity * 0.025` million, which is more than the BEQ.

-   The influencer marketing campaign is profitable and should be approved.

## NPV

-   If the benefits of the marketing campaign come in longer periods, we need to consider the **time value of money** and **use NPV** to evaluate the profitability

$$
N P V=-I_{0}+\frac{CF_{1}}{(1+k)}+\frac{C F_{2}}{(1+k)^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{C F_{n}}{(1+k)^{n}}
$$

## Discount Rate and Discount Factor

-   $k$ is called **discount rate**, which reflects the time value of money

    -   The same £1 today is more valuable than £1 tomorrow

    -   e.g., if interest rate is 10% annually, then £1 today is worth £1.1 a year later

-   $\frac{1}{1+k}$ is called **discount factor,** which is a factor to discount the future CFs to **today**

    -   In each period, we discount the future CF by multiplying it with the discount factor

    -   CF received 1 month later $CF_1$ is worth $\frac{1}{1+k} * CF_1$ today

    -   CF received 2 months later $CF_2$ is worth $\frac{1}{(1+k)^2} * CF_2$ today

-   For a company, $k$ is often estimated by the finance department, which is usually the Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or [WACC](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp)

## PineApple NPV: Step 1

1.  Compute the sequence of monthly cash flows

-   First, we compute the incremental sales percentage for each month, relative to the `r quantity` million.

-   This is a 12-element vector, each element representing the incremental sales percentage.

\footnotesize

```{r}
incremental.sales.percentage_1stmonth <- 0.003
incremental.sales.percentage_next11months <- rep(0.002,11)

# incremental profit each month
vector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months <- 
  c(incremental.sales.percentage_1stmonth,
    incremental.sales.percentage_next11months)

vector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months

```

\normalsize

-   **Interpretation**: 0.003 means that, the first month incremental sales units would be 0.3% of the baseline quantity.

## PineApple NPV: Step 1

-   Next, we multiply the incremental sales **percentage** with **quantity**, to get the **incremental sales in terms of units** for each month.

\footnotesize

```{r}
vector_incremental.sales.units_12months <- 
  vector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months * 
  quantity

vector_incremental.sales.units_12months
```

\normalsize

-   **Interpretation**: 0.03 means that, the first month incremental sales units would be 0.03 million units.

## PineApple NPV: Step 1

-   Lastly, we multiply the **incremental quantity sales** with the **contribution margin per unit**, to get the total contribution margins (incremental profits) for each month, i.e., the CF

\footnotesize

```{r}
vector_CF <- vector_incremental.sales.units_12months * 
  contribution_margin_per_unit

vector_CF
```

\normalsize

-   **Interpretation**: 7.2 means that, the first month incremental net profits would be 7.2 million pounds.

## PineApple NPV: Step 2

2.  Compute the sequence of discount factors

\footnotesize

```{r}
# divide annual wacc to get monthly wacc
monthly_WACC <- 0.1/12 
# monthly wacc is the k in the NPV formula
k <- monthly_WACC
k
# discount factor is 1/(1+k)
discount_factor <- 1/ (1+k)
discount_factor
# Generate a geometric sequence vector of discounted CFs for 12 months
vector_discount_factor <- discount_factor^c(1:12)
vector_discount_factor
```

\normalsize

-   **Interpretation**: `r vector_discount_factor[1]` means that, £1 1 month later is worth £0.992 today; `r vector_discount_factor[12]` means that, £1 12 month later is worth £0.905 today.

## PineApple NPV: Step 3

3.  Compute the NPV

-   Multiply CF vector with discount factor vector, to get the discounted CF vector

```{r}
# this will do element-by-element multiplication
vector_discounted.CF <- vector_CF * vector_discount_factor 
vector_discounted.CF
```

## PineApple NPV: Step 3

-   use function sum() to get the sum of all elements in a vector. That is, the sum of discounted cash flows in all 12 months.

\footnotesize

```{r}
sum(vector_CF * vector_discount_factor)
```

\normalsize

-   We need to subtract the endorsement fee, which is the marketing expense, to get the net present value

\footnotesize

```{r}
NPV <- sum(vector_CF * vector_discount_factor) - endorsement_fee
NPV
```

\normalsize

## Customer Lifetime Value

-   CLV is a break-even analysis from the perspective of **a single customer**, which considers a customer as an asset to the company that generates future cashflows

    -   incurs customer acquisition costs (CAC)

    -   customer generates profits for the company in each period

    -   customer churns at some point in time

## CLV: Formula

$$
\mathrm{CLV} = - CAC + \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{CF_t * r^{(t-1)}}{(1+k)^{t}}
$$

where $CF_t = M_t - c_t$

-   $r$ is the average annual retention rate; $r^{(t-1)}$ is the cumulative retention rate in year $t$
-   $N$ is the number of years over which the relationship is calculated
-   $M_{t}$ is the margin the customer generates in year $t$
-   $c_{t}$ is the expected cost of marketing communications or promotions targeted to the customer in year $t$
-   $k$ is the rate for discounting future cash flows

# Case Study: i-basket CLV

## Situation Analyses: i-basket

-   Company

-   Customer

-   Collaborators

-   Competitors

-   Context/Climate

## Step 1: Determine time unit of analysis

-   Time unit of analysis
    -   *\[...\] (find info in the case study)*

        -   When should we use monthly analysis?

## Step 2: Determine number of years

-   $N$: the number of years over which the customer relationship is assessed
    -   *\[...\] (find info in the case study)*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
N <- 
```

## Step 3: Compute profit margin for each period

$CF = M - c$: **gross profit each year**

-   *most customers paid the \$99 annual membership fee*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
membership <- 
```

\normalsize

-   *40 times each year; each time \$100*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
n_visit <- 
revenue_each_visit <- 
```

## Step 3: Compute profit margin for each period

-   *profit margin 7% (COGS 93%)*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_margin <- 0.07
## think carefully about how M is calculated, it's tricky ~~~~
M <- 
```

\normalsize

-   *variable delivery costs each order*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
deliverycost_each_visit <- 5 + 100 * 0.035
c <- deliverycost_each_visit * n_visit
```

## Step 3: Compute profit margin for each period

-   the annual CF from customers CF

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# CF is the cash flow for one year
CF <- 

# create a sequence of CF for N years 
profit_seq <- rep(CF,N)

```

## Step 4: Compute sequence of retention rate

4.  $r$: retention rate

-   *\[...\] (find info in the case study)*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# retention_rate is the probability of customer staying with us after 1 year
retention_rate <- 
  
# create a geometric sequence of accumulative retention rate for N years  
retention_seq <- 
```

## Step 5: Compute sequence of discount factors

5.  $k$: the discount rate

-   *\[...\] A yearly discount rate of 10%*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
discount_rate <- 0.1
discount_factor_seq <- 
```

\normalsize

-   *\[...\] The team decided to take a conservative approach whereby all profits are booked at the end of year*.
    -   All profits earned per customer in year 1 need to be discounted once, the profits earned in year 2 need to be discounted twice, and so on

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

6.  CAC = **total costs for customer ad clicks** + total costs of \$15 promo + total costs of free deliveries

-   [How the Marketing Funnel Works From Top to Bottom](https://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/how-the-marketing-funnel-works-from-top-to-bottom/)

![](images/funnel.png){fig-align="center"}

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

**6.1 Total costs for customer clicks**

-   \[...\] *a fifth of those who clicked on an ad were willing to give the service a try*
-   *\[...\] 20% of those that signed up for the free trial ended up becoming members*

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
# click_to_trier_rate is the % of trier customers from clickers
click_to_trier_rate <- 0.2

# trier_to_buyer_rate is the % of final customer from trier customers
trier_to_buyer_rate <- 0.2
```

\normalsize

-   How many customers need to click the ad to get 1 new customer?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
n_clicks_1newcustomer <- 1/click_to_trier_rate/trier_to_buyer_rate
```

\normalsize

-   Total costs for customer clicks

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
total_cost_clicks <- 0.4 * n_clicks_1newcustomer
```

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

6.  CAC = total costs for customer ad clicks + **total costs of \$15 promo** + total costs of free deliveries

**6.2 total costs of \$15 promo for first order each trier customer**

-   How many customers need to try the service to get 1 new customer?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
n_triers <- 1/conversion_rate
```

\normalsize

-   What is the total promo cost for these "trier" customers' first order?

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
promo_first_order_each_trier <- 15

total_cost_promo <- promo_first_order_each_trier * (1 - profit_margin) * n_triers
total_cost_promo
```

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

6.  CAC = total costs for customer ad clicks + total costs of \$15 promo + **total costs of free deliveries**

**6.3 total costs from free deliveries**

-   Assume two visits, the delivery costs for each visit

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
deliverycost_1st <- 5 + 115 * 0.035
deliverycost_2nd <- 5 + 100 * 0.035
deliverycost_each_trier <- deliverycost_1st + deliverycost_2nd
```

\normalsize

-   We also make a profit from each trier

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_each_trier <-  revenue_each_visit * profit_margin * 2
```

\normalsize

-   Net delivery costs for each trier

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
NetDeliveryCost_each_trier<- deliverycost_each_trier - profit_each_trier
total_cost_delivery <- NetDeliveryCost_each_trier * n_triers
```

## Step 6: Compute customer acquisition costs

6.  CAC = total costs for customer ad clicks + total costs of \$15 promo + total costs of free deliveries

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
CAC <- total_cost_clicks + total_cost_promo + total_cost_delivery
CAC
```

## Step 7: Compute CLV

7.  Compute the CLV based on the CLV formula (Table A)

<!-- -->

-   7.1 Revenues, variables costs, and profit for the next 5 years

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_seq
```

\normalsize

-   7.2 Apply retention rate

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_seq_after_churn <- profit_seq * retention_seq
```

\normalsize

-   7.3 Apply discount factor

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
profit_seq_after_churn_discount<- profit_seq_after_churn * discount_factor_seq
```

\normalsize

-   7.4 Compute CLV by summing up future expected profits

\footnotesize

```{r}
#| eval: false
CLV <- sum(profit_seq_after_churn_discount) - CAC
```

# CLV for Marketing Decisions

## CLV as a Key Management Tool

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "images/class3_CLVAsDecisionTool.png")
```

**We can use CLV as the key managerial tool for evaluating different marketing initiatives!**

## Discussion

1.  How important is it for i-basket to measure CLV? Can you think of other companies or industries where CLV is particularly relevant?
2.  Conduct sensitivity analyses
    -   what assumptions have we made here? Are these assumptions sensitive to different values?
3.  From our analyses, what suggestions would you offer to i-basket in order to improve its customer profitability? How are you going to evaluate the feasibility of your proposal?
    -   acquisition/development/retention

## Exercise

1.  How much annual membership fee should the company charge to break even?

2.  The company is looking to develop a personalized recommendation system that can increase the average shopping basket to \$150. Compute the upper bound for the company's investment in developing the algorithm in order to break even? Assume the company has 10,000 customers at this moment.
