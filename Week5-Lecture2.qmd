## Revisit of Basic Identity of Causal Inference

-   After assigning individuals into the treatment group and control group, we also observe the outcome for each individual in both groups.

-   We can decompose the **observed** outcome of a treatment into two effects

::: callout-note
## Basic Identity of Causal Inference

Average outcome for treated - Average outcome for untreated

= \[Average outcome for treated - Average counterfactual outcome for treated\] + \[Average counterfactual outcome for treated - Avereage outcome for untreated\]

= **ATT** + **Selection Bias**
:::


## Random Assignment of Individuals

-   Basic Identity of Causal Inference shows why randomized controlled trials are the **gold standard for causal inference**: If the treated group is a random sample of the population,
    -   the first term is an estimate of the causal impact of the treatment on the population
    -   the second term has an expected value of zero.
-   Then by computing the average difference between the treatment group and control group, we obtain the **average treatment effect**!

## Randomized Controlled Trials

::: block
### Randomized Controlled Trials

A **randomized controlled trial** (RCT) is an experimental form of impact evaluation in which the population receiving the program or policy intervention is chosen *at random* from the eligible population, and a control group is also chosen *at random* from the same eligible population.

## Types of RCTs in Marketing: Univariate Testing

**We only vary the level of a single treatment variable (e.g., loyalty program)**

-   A/B testing (treatment group + control group)
    1.  Loyalty program
    2.  No loyalty program
-   A/B/N testing (multiple treatment groups + control group)
    1.  Point-based loyalty program; points can be redeemd for price vouchers
    2.  Point-based loyalty program; points can be redeemd for gifts
    3.  Point-based loyalty program; points can be redeemd for free top ups
    4.  No loyalty program

## Types of RCTs in Marketing: Multivariate Testing

We are interested in multiple treatment variables and their interaction effects.

-   2-by-2 factorial design
    -   treatment group 1: LP Yes + Promo Yes
    -   treatment group 2: LP Yes + Promo No
    -   treatment group 3: LP No + Promo Yes
    -   control group: LP No + Promo No

# Steps to Run a RCT

## Motivating Example

-   Tom is considering whether or not to introduce a loyalty program for his bubble tea business. This decision is essentially a cost-benefit analysis

    -   Cost: it takes money and time to develop the loyalty program

    -   Benefit: it may increase spending and retention rate, and hence future CLV

-   Cost can be estimated through budgeting, but how to estimate the benefit from introducing LP?

-   How you design the experiment is more an art than a science.

## Step 1: Decide on the Unit of Randomization

**In the first step, we decide the level of granularity random assignment should occur at.**

-   individual/household/store/city level

## Step 1: Proposal I

**Proposal 1**: It decides at random to test 'No' in West London and 'Yes' in East London.

-   Do you expect the "at random" to be true randomization?

## Step 1: Proposal II

**Proposal 2**: It randomizes each individual customer to either the 'No' condition or 'Yes' pricing condition.

-   Is this true randomization?

-   What problems can we still have?

## Step 1: Pros and Cons of Granularity

**Disadvantages of granularity:**

-   Costs and logistics

-   Spillovers and crossovers

**Advantages of granularity:**

-   Reduces the chance that the unobserved factors matter ex ante

-   Reduces the chance that there might be a systematic error/unbalance of covariates

**Additional Questions:**

-   How can we randomize individualized price discounts to customers?

## Step 2: Ensure No Spillover and Crossover Effects

-   **Crossover Effects**: A crossover occurs when an individual who was supposed to be assigned to one treatment is accidentally exposed to another treatment.
    -   Solution: Make sure that the same unit receives the same treatment throughout the experiment
-   **Spillover effects**: The behavior of the treatment group can affect control group as well
    -   Solution: Randomize at the level of plausibly isolated social networks such as a community, rather than individual level.

## Step 2: Ensure No Spillover and Crossover Effects

**Proposal**: How should Tom mitigate spillover and crossover effects

## Step 3: Decide on Randomization Allocation Scheme

-   **Complete Randomization**: individuals (or the relevant unit of randomization) are simply allocated at random into a treatment.
    -   Most commonly used; easy to implement; no data required ex ante
-   **Stratified Randomization**: individuals are first divided into subsamples based on certain characteristics, and then randomization is conducted in each subsample
    -   This stratified technique is useful if a covariate is strongly correlated with an outcome.
    -   Limitations: reliable data that would allow such stratification may not be present

**Proposal:** We can use complete randomization as customer purchase history data may not be available.

## Step 4: Collect Data

-   Any field experiment should be aware of the potential need for a large sample size
    -   The larger sample size, the higher statistical power for the experiment
    -   run a power calculation \[[link for tutorial](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/power-calculations)\] if there is a budget
-   Collect both data on the outcome variables of interest and consumer characteristics data

**Proposal:** We need to collect customers' retention rate data and link the retention data with their treatment assignment.

## Step 5: Interpreting Results from a Field Experiment

**Step 5.1: Randomization check**

-   We need to check if the treatment group and control group are indifferent and well-balanced in terms of their **pre-treatment** characteristics.

**Step 5.2: Analyze the data and estimate the ATE**

-   **t-test** to examine the difference in the average outcome between the treatment group and control group. In R, we can use `t.test()`
-   **Regression analysis** (next week)
