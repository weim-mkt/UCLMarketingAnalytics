# Business Objective

## Background

Recently, M&S has launched its highly anticipated [Beauty Advent Calendar for 2024](https://www.marksandspencer.com/c/beauty-box), a curated selection of beauty and skincare products worth over £300. This limited-edition calendar is available to customers for only **£50**. With the holiday season approaching, M&S wants to maximize the reach and response of its marketing campaign by promoting the advent calendar offer to the right customers.

M&S decides to use a conventional mailing marketing strategy, where customers receive color-printed leaflets via Royal Mail to their doorsteps. Each mail costs **£1.5** **to produce** and another **£0.5** **to mail** to the customers. If a customer responds to the offer, M&S expects them to spend **£35** on full-price clothing, homeware or beauty, and purchase the advent calendar at **£50**. The COGS for clothing, homeware, and beauty products is **85%**. And the COGS for the advent calendar is **90%**. 


## Cost-Benefit Analyses

-   **Cost**: Each mail costs **£1.5** **to produce** and another **£0.5** **to mail** to the customers.
-   The cost is the marketing offer we send, `cost_per_offer`

Based on the information provided, calculate the following values:

1. `cost_per_offer`: the cost of sending an marketing offer

## Cost-Benefit Analyses
:::

-   **Benefit**: If customer responds to the offer, the management expects customers to buy our products and generate profits for M&S.

-   The benefit is the profit margin if a customer responds, `profit_per_customer`

2. `profit_per_customer`: the profit from a customer if a customer responds to the marketing offer

## ROI for Blanket Marketing

-   **Blanket marketing**: Send marketing offers to all 2000 customers. Compute the ROI for blanket marketing.

-   We already know the cost of sending an offer is `cost_per_offer`. We can calculate the total marketing costs by multiplying the cost per offer by the number of customers in the dataset.

-   Based on the `Response` variable in the dataset, calculate the total number of customers who responded to the marketing offer. And then calculate the total profit from the marketing campaign.
    
    - Tip: you can use `data_full$Response` to extract the `Response` variable as a vector in the dataset. Based on this vector, you can calculate the total number of responding customers and the total profit from the marketing campaign.


# Targeting Using Supervised Learning

## Break-Even Analysis: Break-Even Response Rate

-   In order to break-even, we can calculate the break-even response rate from customers, which is the **minimum response rate** we need of a customer in order not to lose money from sending the marketing offer[^1]

[^1]: The idea break-even is similar to the break-even quantity we learned in Week 1, the minimum incremental quantity we need to sell in order not to lose any money.

-   Only if a customer responds to us with at least the break-even response rate can we recover the costs of making an marketing offer.

-   If we send offers to customers whose expected response rate is lower than the break-even response rate, we make a loss by expectation.

## Workflow using Supervised Learning

-   **Data collection and cleaning**

    -  Send marketing offers to a random sample of customers and collect their responses (done by M&S)

    -   Split the data into a training set and a test set

-   **Data analytics**

    -   Train predictive models on the training set

    -   Predict customer response rate on the test set

-   **Business recommendations**

    -   Target customers based on predicted response rate

    -   Compute and compare ROIs for each targeting method: (1) blanket marketing; (2) decision tree; (3) random forest

# Improve Marketing Efficiency Using Supervised Learning

## Customer Life Cycle

-   Acquisition

    -   Use predictive analytics to target responsive customers to reduce marketing costs

-   Development

    -   Use predictive analytics to recommend products to customers (personalized recommendation system); for each customer, promote the item with the highest purchase probability

-   Retention

    -   Use predictive analytics to find valuable customers who are likely to churn and conduct targeted churn management
