# Intro to Marketing Analytics

-   Situation analysis (5C analysis)

## Week 1: Break-Even Analysis

-   Break-even analysis is essential to any business activity
    -   For business campaigns: Break-even quantity (BEQ) and Net present value (NPV)
    -   For customers: Customer lifetime value (CLV)
-   BEA is essentially cost-benefit analysis

# Descriptive Analytics

## Week 2: Data Wrangling with `dplyr`

-   Data manipulation with `dplyr`
    -   basic operations: `filter`, `mutate`, `select`, `arrange`
    -   group aggregation: `group_by`
    -   multi-data joining: `left_join`
-   [Tesco case study](https://weim-mkt.github.io/UCLMarketingAnalytics/Case-PreliminaryCustomerAnalysis.html): Preliminary customer analysis using `dplyr`

## Week 2: Hey, I'm Wei, and I'm a musician!

# Predictive Analytics

## Week 3: Unsupervised Learning for Customer Segmentation

-   Unsupervised learning such as K-means clustering help classify individuals into different segments.
-   We then decide which segment(s) to serve based on our business objective.

## Week 4: Supervised Learning for Customer Targeting

-   Unsupervised learning is often not the most powerful tool for STP.

:::

-   Supervised learning models learn the relationship between outcome $Y$ and $X$ and can make **individualized** prediction.

## Week 4: Fundamental Tradeoffs in Supervised Learning

-   Accuracy-interpretability tradeoff

    -   linear regression (high interpretability, low accuracy)

    -   decision tree and random forest (good interpretability, good accuracy)

    -   deep learning (no interpretability, high accuracy, term 2)

-   Bias-variance trade-off

## Week 4: Application in Marketing: Personalized Targeting

-   With **targeted marketing** from supervised learning, we can effectively reduce marketing costs and boost the ROI.

# Causal Inference

![](images/causal inference road map.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## Week 5: Why Causal Inference Matters?

-   Managers easily make costly mistakes if they do not understand causal inference.

## Week 5: I'm Wei and I'm from Hogwarts

![](images/magic2023.png){fig-align="center" width="424"}

## Week 6 & 7 : OLS Regression and Marketing Mix Modeling

-   Simple linear regression from secondary data can give causal inference **if and only if all confounding factors have been controlled** in the regression. In reality, this **never** happens, so linear regression can **never** give causal effects.

![](images/directindirecteffect.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   In practice, companies often use linear regression to build **marketing mix modeling**, in order to set optimal prices for profit maximization (profit is often considered a quadratic function of price).

## Week 8: Endogeneity and Instrument Variables

-   Endogeneity
    -   Omitted variable bias
    -   Reverse causality/Simultaneity
    -   Measurement error
-   An instrument variable can give causal inference, which satisfies
    -   Exogeneity: instrument is exogeneous and beyond individual control
    -   Relevance: instrument affects X
    -   Observable (implicit)

## Week 8: Endogeneity and Instrument Variables

1.  Explain $X$ with $Z$. The predicted $X$, $\hat{X}$, is uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon$ in the original regression.
    -   **Important: other control variables are also considered exogenous and should be included in both stages.**

$$
X_{i}=Z\eta+\epsilon_{i}
$$

2.  Use the explained part $\hat{X}$ to explain $y$, now $\hat{X}$ is exogenous and can give us causal inference.
    -   [COVID-19 case study](https://weim-mkt.github.io/UCLMarketingAnalytics/Case-COVID-IV.html): The causal impact of COVID-19 on Uber Driver Decision
    -   third assignment

$$
y_{i}=\hat{X} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(\hat{X}_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) = 0
$$

## Week 9: Regression Discontinuity Design

![](images/RDD.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Causal effect of "Distinction" on students' salaries
-   Regression Discontinuity in Time (RDiT)

## Week 9: Difference-in-Differences

![](images/DiDGraph.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   A new policy/regulation (GDPR, lockdown, etc.) and we have a control group which remains unaffected

## One Causal Question, Many Solutions

-   If we have historical data on **number of restaurants on UberEat** in each month, and **the total number of orders in each month**, can we get the causal effect?

$$
NumOrders_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 NumRestaurants_t + \epsilon_t
$$

-   Solutions
    -   RCT
    -   Instrumental Variable
    -   DiD
    -   RDD
    -   RDiT

# Concluding Remarks

## 10 Weeks Not Enough?

-   I love new challenges so my door is always open even after the class/program is over

-   More learning materials

    -   Optional reading materials in each week
    -   I will keep uploading R tutorials/data analytics tools tutorials on my Youtube channel. **It's never too late to subscribe!**

## What I learned

-   Impressed with your perseverance and willingness to learn
    -   My bestie predicts you would chase me out of the classroom for making you learn Marketing, R, and so many new models at the same time
-   You've made me very proud:
    -   It gives me a huge sense of achievement to see that you are able to apply the tools learned in various scenarios!

    -   It gives me a weird sense of achievement to receive and answer questions for other modules :))

    -   **R is the best language!!!! No Disagreement Allowed!!!!!!!!**

## Looking into the Future

-   Any case study in the marketing module can be used for your term 3 dissertation project.
    -   Welcome to talk to me about your ideas; always happy to supervise
-   \[**IMPORTANT**\]: **Start early for your job market**; use alumni resources (Linkedin) to network.
-   Let's stay in touch even after graduation!

## Thank you for being the BEST Students I can ever dream of!!

**Thank you so much for your hard work and your support of the Marketing Analytics module throughout the term!**

Though probably in 5 years you may have forgotten everything learned but only remember the following

-   A module leader with a bubble tea belly uploads lousy weekly videos
-   but he tries his best to be a good musician, Youtuber, magician, and stand-up comedian (and most importantly a good lecturer)
-   A lame senior named Tom, who messed up everything and made you do so many assignments
