# Preface: How to Use This Guide

## Arrangements each week

We will have a 3-hour session each Thursday and I will aim to cover a new marketing analytics model each week. Whenever we learn a new technique (e.g., a new statistical model or a new analytics tool), the subsequent week will often start with some warm-up exercise and a seminar workshop (with a case study) for you to review and practice the new technique learned in the previous week. This way, you would have time to digest what you've learned and can further reflect on your understanding of the technique by practicing your skills with a real-life application.

For instance, on Thursday 6 Oct (Week 1), I will first introduce the concepts of marketing and marketing process, and then will cover the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV) and how to compute CLV with R. In week 2, we will therefore begin with a case study that helps you practice your knowledge of CLV, so you can understand how to use CLV for better marketing decisions in your future projects/jobs.

In the remaining time of week 2, I will then introduce a new technique: the `dplyr` package in R, which helps us clean and manipulate datasets in R. Following a similar logic, then in week 3, we will start with a case study for you to practice the `dplyr` package. So on and so forth.

## About the labels

-   Essential: contents core to this week's materials. All pre-class preparations should be completed before class.
-   Optional: supplemental readings for those interested in learning more

All materials, including the lecture slides and before-class readings will be released a few days before each Thursday's class.

    -   In the first class this week, we will go through how to compute the customer lifetime value for i-basket in this case study. We will only discuss the CLV calculation part and you can finish the CLSV as an after-class exercise. **Please read pages 1 - 8, focusing on pages 5 - 8.**

    -   When reading the case, please fill in the table at the beginning of the quarto document to find out all key information, including the variable, the value, and the page where it shows up. This can help you quickly find that information in class.

    -   Prepare for the following questions, which we will discuss in class.

        1.  What would be the time unit of analyses? monthly or yearly? How many years of customer lifetime to consider for CLV calculation?

        2.  What is the information needed to calculate the net cashflow of a customer in each period? Where can you find the M and c in the CLV formula? Highlight these key numbers so that we can create them in R directly. 

        3.  How do we incorporate customer churn in CLV calculation?

        4.  What are the costs i-basket needs to incur to acquire a customer? Based on this information, how to compute the customer acquisition costs (CAC)?
