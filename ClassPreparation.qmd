# Preface: How to Use This Guide

## Arrangements each week 

We will have a 3-hour lecture each Thursday and I will aim to cover a new marketing analytics model each week. Whenever we learn a new technique (e.g., a new statistical model or a new analytics tool), the subsequent week will often start with some warm-up exercise and a workshop (with a case study) for you to review and practice the new technique learned in the previous week. This way, you would have time to digest what you've learned and can further reflect on your understanding of the technique by practicing your skills with a real-life application.


For instance, on Thursday 6 Oct (Week 1), I will first introduce the concepts of marketing and marketing process, and then will cover the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV) and how to compute CLV with R. In week 2, we will therefore begin with a case study that helps you practice your knowledge of CLV, so you can understand how to use CLV  for better marketing decisions in your future projects/jobs. 

In the remaining time of week 2, I will then introduce a new technique: the `dplyr` package in R, which helps us clean and manipulate datasets in R. Following a similar logic, then in week 3, we will start with a case study for you to practice the `dplyr` package. So on and so forth. 

## About the labels

- Essential: contents core to this weekâ€™s materials. All pre-class preparations should be completed before class.
- Optional: supplemental readings for those interested in learning more

All materials, including the lecture slides and before-class readings will be released a few days before each Thursday's class.
