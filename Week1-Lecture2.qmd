# Break-Even Analysis

## Decisions for Marketing Managers

-   Ultimate goal of marketing: create value and improve profitability for firms

-   As any marketing activity comes with a cost, data analysts need to correctly evaluate whether a campaign creates or destroys value to the company. 

-   Such analyses are called cost-benefit analyses (sometimes referred to as profitability analysis or break-even analysis in different contexts.

## Some Concepts

Marketers often refer to the difference between the **price per unit** and **variable costs per unit** as the **contribution margin per unit**. That is,

$$
Contribution Margin Per Unit = Price Per Unit - Variable Costs Per Unit
$$

-   **Price per unit**: retail price customers pay

-   **Variable costs per unit:** Costs of goods sold (COGS)[^1] + any other variable costs per unit

[^1]: Material and production labor costs for producing a unit of product; often represented in **percentage terms,** e.g., COGS of 60% means the costs are 60% of retail prices. An iPhone with a retail price of £1000 and COGS of 60% means the COGS is £600.

## Apple Inc: Background

Tom, senior marketing manager of Apple UK, is looking to launch a series of marketing campaigns to promote the new products just released. Tom was a proud graduate from UCL MSc BA program in 2020, and he remembered from  the Marketing Analytics module that break-even analysis to help evaluate different types of marketing decisions.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
price <- 600 # retail price at £600
quantity <- 10 # sales in million units
COGS <- 0.6 # cost of goods sold, meaning the cost of producing an iPhone is £600
RD_costs <- 100 # operating and marketing costs; in million pounds
endorsement_fee <- 50 # endorsement; in million pounds
```
:::

**Case objectives:**

-   Practice situation analysis

-   Practice how to conduct break-even analyses for a marketing compaign

-   Practice R basic computations and vector operations

## Apple Inc: Key Information

**From the case:** The marketing analytics team at Apple Inc had applied predictive analytics models on historical sales data and predicted that the sales this year will reach **`r quantity`** million units at the retail price of **£`r price`**, without any additional marketing activities. The team had also collected the information on the Cost of Goods Sold of Apple 16, which is **`r COGS *100`%**. The Research and Development (R&D) costs for iPhone 16 is **`r RD_costs`** million pounds.

-   Open the .qmd answer sheet downloaded from Moodle. And let's solve this case using the R basics we learned last week!

## Apple Inc: BEA

-   **Question 1:** Compute the contribution margin

    -   Do we need to consider R&D costs?

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
contribution_margin <- (1 - COGS) * price
contribution_margin
```
:::

-   **Question 2**: Based on the information at hand, should Tom approve the influencer marketing plan?

# Net Present Value

## Definition of NPV

-   When the effect of the marketing campaign is expected to have a long-term effect or **when time value of money is important** to the question at hand, we need to take the future into account.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Definition

Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time.
:::

## Formula of NPV

$$
N P V=-I_{0}+\frac{CF_{1}}{(1+k)}+\frac{C F_{2}}{(1+k)^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{C F_{n}}{(1+k)^{n}}
$$

-   $I_{0}$ is the initial marketing investment/expense

-   $C F_{n}$ is the **incremental** sales in period $n$: it must be the additional sales due to the marketing campaign

-   $k$ is the discount rate: reflects the value of time: the same £1 today is more valuable than £1 tomorrow

-   The decision rule

    -   if NPV \> 0, then the marketing campaign can bring in more values to the company, accept

    -   if NPV \< 0, then the marketing campaign will decrease the company's value, reject

## Apple Inc: NPV Influencer Marketing I

**Question 3:** Based on the information at hand, should Tom approve the influencer marketing plan based on Net Present Value method?

1.  Compute the sequence of monthly cash flows
    -   Generate a sequence of incremental sales for 12 months (a vector with 12 elements)
        -   Hint: use `rep()`, `c()`, and vector element-wise multiplication

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
monthly_sales_increase_1stmonth <- 0.003
monthly_sales_increase_after <- 0.002
# incremental profit each month
monthly_incremental_sales <- c(monthly_sales_increase_1stmonth,
                     rep(monthly_sales_increase_after,11))

CF <-  monthly_incremental_sales * 
                    quantity * 
                    contribution_margin 
```
:::

The resulting monthly CFs are: `r CF`

## Apple Inc: NPV Influencer Marketing II

2.  Compute the sequence of discount factors
    -   Generate a sequence of WACC for 12 months (a vector with 12 elements)
    -   Generate a sequence of discount factor for 12 months (a vector with 12 elements)
        -   Hint: use `seq()` to generate geometric sequence with patterns

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
monthly_WACC <- 0.1/12 
discount_factor <- (1/(1+monthly_WACC))^c(1:12)
```
:::

The resulting monthly discount factors are: `r discount_factor`

## Apple Inc: NPV Influencer Marketing III

3.  Compute the NPV
    -   Generate a sequence of discounted CFs for 12 months
    -   Sum up all discounted CFs across the 12 months using `sum()`
    -   Subtract endorsement fee from the sum to get NPV

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
NetPresentValue <- sum(CF * discount_factor) - endorsement_fee
```
:::

-   The NPV is `r NetPresentValue`

## Customer Acquisition Cost

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
### Definition

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** is the cost of winning a customer to purchase a product or service.
:::

-   Why should we care about CAC? Having a new customer may not always be a good thing. For example, no company would spend £500 to acquire a new customer worth £300

## How to Acquire New Customers

## Customer Acquisition Cost: Calculation

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

When the marketing cost can be attributed to each individual customer

-   CAC = (# of offers needed to acquire 1 customer) \* (cost of making a marketing offer)
-   CAC = (cost of making a marketing offer) / (customer response rate)
:::

-   After we study predictive analytics later in this module, we will be able to predict response rate for each individual customer and compute individual-specific CAC.

## Customer Acquisition Cost: An Example

A new Bubble Tea shop in Canary Wharf is contemplating whether or not to attract new customers by sending ads leaflets to nearby residents.

The cost of sending a leaflet, which includes production and labor costs, is **£0.5**.

1.  randomly sending out leaflets
    -   expected response rate of **1%**
2.  using names purchased from a marketing agency
    -   each name costs **£0.2**
    -   expected response rate of **4%** by analyzing the buying behavior and demographics of current customers

Compute the CAC for each choice.

::: {.content-hidden when-format="beamer"}
```{r}
cost_per_random_offer <- 0.5
response_rate_random_offer <- 0.01
# Following the formula in the previous slide
CAC_random_offer <- cost_per_random_offer / response_rate_random_offer
CAC_random_offer
```

```{r}
cost_per_targeted_offer <- 0.5 + 0.2 
response_rate_targeted_offer <- 0.04
CAC_targeted_offer <- cost_per_targeted_offer/response_rate_targeted_offer
CAC_targeted_offer
```

:::

## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

Customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV) is the total worth to a business of a customer over the whole period of their relationship.
:::

-   The underlying idea of CLV is essentially NPV, but at the customer level.
    -   Think of acquiring a new customer as an investment in an "asset" that can generate future cash flows

## CLV: Calculation

$$
\mathrm{CLV} = - CAC + \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{CF_t * r^{(t-1)}}{(1+k)^{t}},
where \space CF_t = M_t - c_t
$$

-   $r$ is the average annual retention rate; $r^{(t-1)}$ is the cumulative retention rate in year $t$
-   $N$ is the number of years over which the relationship is calculated
-   $M_{t}$ is the margin the customer generates in year $t$
-   $c_{t}$ is the expected cost of marketing communications or promotions targeted to the customer in year $t$
-   $k$ is the rate for discounting future cash flows

## Retention Rate

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Definition

The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity.
:::

-   retention rate = 1 - churn rate

-   **How to compute *individual* churn rate**: machine learning models to predict the churn rate of an individual customer (Week 4)

## Number of Years of Customer Relationship

-   If we assume **infinite** customer economic life, we can simplify the formula into the following using the property of geometric sequence.

$$
C L V_{N} = \sum_{t=1}^{N} \frac{g r^{(t-1)}}{(1+k)^{t}} => C L V_{N}=\mathrm{g} \cdot \frac{1-\left(\frac{r}{1+k}\right)^{N}}{1+k-r}  => 
C L V_{\infty}=\frac{g}{(1+k-r)}
$$

-   However, most of the time, we are more comfortable to assume **finite** customer economic life; we need to decide on a cutoff date for CLV calculation
    -   Rule 1: until the year when the $g = M-c$ becomes negative
    -   Rule 2: industry's average customer lifespan

## After-class

-   Review the coding practice in today's class.

- Complete the R coding exercise for Week 1.
