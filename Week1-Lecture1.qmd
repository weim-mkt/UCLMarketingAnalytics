## What is Marketing? {.auto-stretch}

-   Kotler (1991): "Marketing is a social and managerial process by which individuals and groups obtain what they **want and need** through **creating**, **offering** and **exchanging** products of value with others."

-   British Chartered Institute of Marketing (2000s): "Marketing is the **management process** responsible for **identifying, anticipating and satisfying** customers' requirements **profitably**."

-   American Marketing Association (2017): "Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and **processes** for creating, communicating, delivering, and **exchanging** offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."

## Marketing Process

![Marketing Process](images/MarketingProcess.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   We will go through the above concepts.

## Situation Analysis: 5 C's

-   Any marketing decision can benefit from a deep understanding of the players within the market ecosystem---your own company, current and potential customers, collaborators and competitors---and the context they interact within: the 5Cs for short.

![5Cs of Marketing](images/5C.png){#5c fig-align="center" width="200"}

## Situation Analysis: Competitors

-   Managers tend to pay attention towards more salient direct (industry) competitors, but we should also consider indirect and potential competitors.

    -   Indirect competitors are defined by who your customers consider to satisfy the same goals.

    -   Potential competitors are those who might pose a competitive threat in the future; who possess equivalent resources that would allow them to enter the market

![Situation Analysis: Competitors](images/competitoranalysis.png){#competitoranalysis fig-align="center" width="200"}

## Situation Analysis: Context/Climate

-   **Context/Climate analysis** is a strategic planning method used to assess major external factors that influence the market ecosystem, and is often referred to as **PESTLE analysis**.


![Situation Analysis: Context](images/class1_Context.png){#contextanalysis fig-align="center" width="200"}

## Strategy: STP

-   Situation analysis is a critical input into marketing strategy design, the sequential application of the processes of segmentation, targeting, and positioning. Marketing strategy is inherently related to the concepts of the business model and business strategy---who you are serving, with what value proposition, and how you do so.

![Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning](images/STP.png){#STP fig-align="center" width="200"}


## Tactics: 4P's

-   The marketing mix provides an implementation of your positioning. Segmentation is here applied at the tactical level, to optimally design the marketing mix or 4Ps.

# Marketing Analytics

## Big Data Era

With the advancement in information and communication technologies (ICTs), data scientists nowadays are equipped with data analytics tools powerful than ever!

Firms now have access to enormously rich information trail of customers

-   Demographic profiles (DoB, gender, ethnicity, income)
-   Purchase history (recency, frequency, monetary value, spending behavior)
-   Online browsing and search history (browsing, click through, add to cart, purchase)
-   GPS data from mobile phones for offline store visits
-   Social media (location, consumer preference, social network)
