-   British Chartered Institute of Marketing (2000s): "Marketing is the **management process** responsible for **identifying, anticipating and satisfying** customers' requirements **profitably**."

-   American Marketing Association (2017): "Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and **processes** for creating, communicating, delivering, and **exchanging** offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large."

## Situation Analysis: Company

-   **Company analysis** is a strategic planning method used to assess the internal strengths and weaknesses of your company.

    -   **Business model** is the way your company makes money.

    -   **Goals, objectives, and culture** are the guiding principles that shape your company's actions.

-   **Customer** is the most important player in the market ecosystem.

    -   **Market size, segments** are the number of potential customers and the different groups they can be divided into.

    -   **Overall customer satisfaction and perceived value by customers** are the key to marketing success.

::: callout
-   What is the business model of Uber? Does it directly provide transportation services? If not, who does?

-   Who are Uber's customers?
:::

## Situation Analysis: Collaborators

-   **Collaborators** are entities that work with your company to help you deliver your product or service to the customer.

    -   **Suppliers** provide the raw materials or components needed to produce your product.
    -   **Distributors** help you get your product to the customer.
    -   **Retailers** sell your product to the customer.

::: callout
-   Who are the collaborators of Uber?
:::

## Situation Analysis: Competitors

-   We tend to pay more attention towards more salient direct competitors, but we should also consider indirect and potential competitors.

    -   Indirect competitors are companies that satisfy the same customer goals, even if they offer different products or services.

    -   Potential competitors are those who might pose a competitive threat in the future; who possess equivalent resources that would allow them to enter the market
