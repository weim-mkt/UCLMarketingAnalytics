title: "Class 13 Case Study: Improve User Engagement for Instagram Using A/B/N Testing"
---

# Case Background

## Business Objective

- Instagram aims to increase user engagement and activity.

- We can propose gamification strategies based on scientific theories.

- Need to empirically test whether proposed gamification strategies are effective using A/B/N testings.

## Situation Analysis

Conduct a situation analysis to assess Instagramâ€™s business environment in the UK:^[Suggested answers are on the course website.]

-   What is Instagram's business model?

-   How does Instagram make revenues?

-   Who are Instagram's customers?

-   What are the major competitors and their relative strengths and weaknesses compared with Instagram?

-   Who are the collaborators of Instagram?

-   PESTLE analysis: any particular legal and regulatory issues that Instagram needs to be aware of?

# Theoretical Motivations

## Theoretical Motivation for Business Ideas

- When proposing business ideas, we should base our proposals on scientific, well-established theories from different disciplines.

    - **Bottom-up approach**: start with theories and then generate business ideas

    - **Top-down approach**: start with business ideas and then find theories to support them

- Let's first see some examples of behavioral economics theories!

## Behavioral Theories

- [Framing effect](https://www.investopedia.com/framing-effect-7371439)

- [Endowment effect](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/endowment-effect.asp)

- [Mental accounting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mentalaccounting.asp)

## Default Effect

## Social Comparison Theory

- People evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others, especially when comparing oneself to similar others.

- Social comparison can be upward or downward.

- Social comparison can motivate people to improve their performance; however, it can also lead to negative emotions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("images/Week 7/Social Comparison Theory.jpeg")
```

## Prospect Theory

- Prospect theory posits that people feel more pain from losing something than pleasure from gaining something.

- This theory can be used to explain why people are more likely to engage in activities that prevent loss than those that promote gain.

#| echo: false

```

## Business Proposal

- Implement gamification features on Instagram to increase user activity based on the theories of Social Comparison and Prospect Theory.

- Let's think about ideas that can boost user engagement on Instagram.

## Potential Strategies

- **Endowment effect**: Implementing a points and badge system to create sense of ownership and encourage engagement (e.g., likes, comments, shares).

- **Social comparison theory**: Leaderboards showing top users; Social comparison through activity rankings

- **Prospect theory**: Time-limited rewards and achievements

# A/B/N Testing for Instagram

## Step 1: Decide on the Unit of Randomization

-   What would be the best unit of randomization?

## Step 2: Mitigate Spillover and Crossover Effects

-   What are the potential problems for spillover and crossover?

## Step 3: Decide on Randomization Allocation Scheme

-   How should we determine the randomization scheme?

## Step 4: Collect Data

-   What is the sample size we need?

-   What data should we collect?

## Step 5: Data analytics

-   Randomization checks

-   How to estimate the treatment effects?
