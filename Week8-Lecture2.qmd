# Instrumental Variable

## Class Objectives

-   The requirements of a valid instrumental variable and how to find good instruments

-   Intuition of why instrumental variables solve endogeneity problems

-   Apply two-stage least square method to estimate the causal effects using instrumental variables


## Causal Inference from OLS

-   From non-experimental secondary data, it is impossible to control all confounding factors, which means we can never obtain causal effects from OLS regressions.

-   Can we still obtain causal inference from secondary data?

## What is an Instrumental Variable

::: block
### Instrumental Variable

An instrumental variable is a set of variables $Z$ that satisfies the following requirements:

1.  $z$ is exogeneous and uncorrelated with $\epsilon$; that is, $cov(Z,\epsilon) = 0$

2.  $z$ only affects $Y$ through $X$, but not directly affect $Y$

3.  $z$ affects $x$ to some extent, that is, $cov(Z,x) \neq 0$

:::

\small

-   Point 1 is called **exogeneity** requirement: the instrumental variable should be beyond individual's control, such that the instrumental variables are uncorrelated with any individual's unobserved confounding factors.

    -   Potential IVs: government policy; natural disasters; randomized experiment; birthdays; etc.

-  Point 2 is called **exclusion restriction**: the instrumental variable should only affect $Y$ through $X$, but not directly affect $Y$.

-   Point 3 is called **relevance requirement**: though beyond an individual's control, the instrumental variable should still affect the individual's $X$, causing some exogenous changes in $X$ that is beyond individual control.
    
    - If the correlation between $z$ and $x$ is too small, we have a [**weak IV** problem]((https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/12.3-civ.html)).

## A Classic Example of Instrumental Variable

**Return of Military Service to Lifetime Income**[^1]

[^1]: Angrist, Joshua D., Stacey H. Chen, and Jae Song. "Long-term consequences of Vietnam-era conscription: New estimates using social security data." *American Economic Review* 101, no. 3 (2011): 334-38.

$$
Income = \beta_0 + \beta_1MilitaryService + \epsilon
$$

-   OLS suffers from endogeneity problems. What are the potential endogeneity issues?

-   A lottery was used to determine if soldiers with certain birthdays are drafted to the frontline.

## A Classic Example of Instrumental Variable

-   The date of birth ($z$) or zodiacs can be an **instrumental variable** for military service ($x$) in this case.
    - Relevance requirement: Affects years of military service: $cov(z,x) \neq 0$
    - Exogeneity requirement: Randomly drawn and thus uncorrelated with any confounders: $cov(z,\epsilon) = 0$
    - Exclusion restriction: $z$ only affects $Y$ through $X$, but not directly affect $Y$.

# Two-Stage Least Squares

## Solving Endogeneity Using IV

-   Given an endogenous OLS regression,

$$
    y_{i}=X_{i} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(X_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) \neq 0
$$

-   Find instrumental variables $Z_i$ that do not (directly) inï¬‚uence $y_i$ , but are correlated with $X_i$

## Two-Stage Least Squares: Stage 1

1.  Run a regression with `X ~ Z`. The predicted $\hat X$ is predicted by Z, which should be uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon$.
    -   $\hat{X}$ (the part of changes in $X$ due to $Z$) is exogenous, because $Z$ is exogenous
    -   All endogenous parts are now left over in the error term in the first-stage regression $\epsilon_{i}$

$$
X_{i}=Z_{i}\eta+\epsilon_{i}
$$

## Two-Stage Least Squares: Stage 2

2.  Run a regression with $Y$ \~ $\hat{X}$: now $\hat{X}$ is uncorrelated with the error term and thus we can get causal inference from the second stage regression.

$$
y_{i}=\hat{X} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(\hat{X}_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) = 0
$$

## After-Class Readings

-  Next week, we are going to discuss a case study using IV and 2SLS. Please read the case study before the next class.
