# Instrumental Variable

## Causal Inference from OLS

-   From non-experimental secondary data, it is impossible to control all confounding factors, which means we can never obtain causal effects from OLS regressions.

-   Is there still a way for us to obtain causal inference from secondary data?

## What is an Instrumental Variable

::: block
### Instrumental Variable

An instrumental variable is a set of variables $Z$ that satisfies two requirements:

1.  $z$ is exogeneous and uncorrelated with $\epsilon$; that is, $cov(Z,\epsilon) = 0$

2.  $z$ affects $x$ to some extent, that is, $cov(Z,x) \neq 0$
:::

-   Point 1 is called **exogeneity** requirement (**exclusion restriction** requirement): the instrumental variable should be beyond individual's control, such that the instrumental variables are uncorrelated with any individual's unobserved confounding factors.

    -   Potential IVs: government policy; natural disasters; randomized experiment; etc.

-   Point 2 is called **relevance requirement**: though beyond an individual's control, the instrumental variable should still affect the individual's $X$, causing some exogenous changes in $X$ that is beyond individual control.

## A Classic Example of Instrumental Variable

**Return of Military Service to Lifetime Income**[^1]

[^1]: Angrist, Joshua D., Stacey H. Chen, and Jae Song. "Long-term consequences of Vietnam-era conscription: New estimates using social security data." *American Economic Review* 101, no. 3 (2011): 334-38.

$$
Income = \beta_0 + \beta_1MilitaryService + \epsilon
$$

-   OLS suffers from endogeneity problems, for example

    -   Individual ability/health correlates with military service and affects income

-   A lottery was used to determine if soldiers with certain birthdays are drafted.

-   The date of birth ($z$) is an **instrumental variable**

    -   Affects years of military service: $cov(z,x) \neq 0$
    -   Randomly drawn and thus uncorrelated with any confounders: $cov(z,\epsilon) = 0$

## IV Requirement I: Exogeneity

-   Exogeneity requires that $z$ should only affect $Y$ through $X$, but not directly affect $Y$.
-   The instrumental variable should be beyond an individual's control. Because omitted variable bias is often caused by individual's own selection, instrumental variables are thus not correlated with any omitted variables.

## IV Requirement II: Relevance

-   The instrumental variable must be sufficiently correlated with $x$.
-   If the correlation between $z$ and $x$ is too small, we have a **weak IV** problem.
-   For more mathematical details of the weak IV issue, refer to this [resource](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/12.3-civ.html).

-   Number of restaurants on UberEat =\> Number of orders on UberEat

-   Retail price =\> Sales

# Two-Stage Least Square

## Solving Endogeneity Using IV

-   Given an endogenous OLS regression,

$$
    y_{i}=X_{i} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(X_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) \neq 0
$$

-   Find instrumental variables $Z_i$ that do not (directly) inï¬‚uence $y_i$ , but are correlated with $X_i$

## Two-Stage Least Squares: Stage 1

1.  Run a regression with `X ~ Z`. The predicted $\hat X$ is predicted by Z, which should be uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon$.
    -   $\hat{X}$ (the part of changes in $X$ due to $Z$) is exogenous, because $Z$ is exogenous
    -   All endogenous parts are now left over in the error term in the first-stage regression $\epsilon_{i}$

$$
X_{i}=Z_{i}\eta+\epsilon_{i}
$$

## Two-Stage Least Squares: Stage 2

2.  Run a regression with $Y$ \~ $\hat{X}$: now $\hat{X}$ is uncorrelated with the error term and thus we can get causal inference from the second stage regression.

$$
y_{i}=\hat{X} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(\hat{X}_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) = 0
$$

# Application: Causal Effects of COVID-19

## Causal Impact of COVID-19

-   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruptions to many industries, and platform businesses, especially sharing economy platforms, are among the most disrupted ones.

-   How would you evaluate the causal impact of COVID-19 cases on the company's business and profits?

    -   Can we collect data on the *COVID cases* and *sales* and run an OLS regression to get the causal effect? What would hinder us from causal inference from the above OLS regressions?

## Causal Impact of COVID-19 on Uber Drivers' Labor Supply

-   In this case study, we will see an application of instrumental variable in evaluating the causal impact of COVID-19 on Uber drivers' labor supply decision.

-   Let's take out the Quarto document.

## Beyond the Impact of COVID-19 on Labor Supply

-   You can follow this case study and propose similar topics for your term 3 dissertation project, depending on the company you work with.

-   For similar causal inference interview questions/data science tasks, when RCTs are difficult to implement, instrumental variable method can be a very powerful solution.
