# Instrumental Variable

## Causal Inference from OLS

-   The necessary condition for OLS to reveal causal effect is: all confounding variables (i.e., variables that are correlated with $X$ and affect outcome variable) are controlled in the regression.

-   Otherwise, the OLS estimator will be biased and we can only obtain the **total effect (correlation)** rather than the **direct effect (causal effect)**.

-   From secondary data, we will **never** be able to control all confounding factors, which means we can never obtain causation from OLS regressions.

-   So, is there still a way for us to obtain causal inference from secondary data?

## What is an Instrumental Variable

::: block
### Instrumental Variable

An instrumental variable is a variable $z$ that satisfies two requirements:

1.  $z$ is uncorrelated with $\epsilon$; that is, $cov(z,\epsilon) = 0$

2.  $z$ is correlated with $x$; that is, $cov(z,x) \neq 0$
:::

-   Point 1 is called **exogeneity requirement**: the instrumental variable should be beyond an individual's control, such that the instrumental variable will not be correlated with any individual's choices/omitted variables.

    -   The spirit is similar to RCT's randomization

-   Point 2 is called **relevance requirement**: though beyond an individual's control, the instrumental variable should still affect the individual's $X$, causing some exogenous variations in $X$.

## A Classic Example of Instrumental Variable

**Return of Military Service to Lifetime Income**[^1] $$
Income = \beta_0 + \beta_1MilitaryService + \epsilon
$$

[^1]: Angrist, Joshua D., Stacey H. Chen, and Jae Song. "Long-term consequences of Vietnam-era conscription: New estimates using social security data." *American Economic Review* 101, no. 3 (2011): 334-38.

-   OLS suffers from endogeneity problems, for example

    -   individual ability correlates with military service and affects income
    -   individual health status correlates with military service and affects income

-   A draft lottery was used to determine if a soldier with a certain birthday goes to the war.

-   The date of birth ($z$) is an **instrumental variable**

    -   is correlated with military service: $cov(z,x) \neq 0$
    -   but does not directly affect income: $cov(z,\epsilon) = 0$

## IV Requirement I: Exogeneity

-   Exogeneity requires that $z$ should only affect $Y$ through $X$, but not directly affect $Y$.
-   The instrumental variable should be beyond an individual's control. Because omitted variable bias is often caused by individual's own selection, instrumental variables are thus not correlated with omitted variable bias.

## IV Requirement II: Relevance

-   The instrumental variable must be sufficiently correlated with $x$.
-   If the correlation between $z$ and $x$ is too small, we have a **weak IV** problem.
-   For more mathematical details of the weak IV issue, refer to this [resource](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/12.3-civ.html).

# Two-Stage Least Square

## Solving Endogeneity Using IV

-   Given an endogenous OLS regression, $$
    y_{i}=X_{i} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(X_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) \neq 0
    $$
-   Find instrumental variables $Z_i$ that do not (directly) inï¬‚uence $y_i$ , but are correlated with $X_i$

## Two-Stage Least Squares: Stage 1

1.  Run a regression with X \~ Z. The predicted $X$ is predicted by Z, which should be uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon$.
    -   $\hat{X}$ (predicted $X$ from $Z$) is exogenous, because $Z$ is exogenous
    -   All endogenous parts are now left in the error term in the first-stage regression $\epsilon_{i}$

$$
X_{i}=Z_{i}\eta+\epsilon_{i}
$$

## Two-Stage Least Squares: Stage 2

2.  Run a regression with $Y$ \~ $\hat{X}$: now $\hat{X}$ is uncorrelated with the error term and thus we can get causal inference from the second stage regression.

$$
y_{i}=\hat{X} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(\hat{X}_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) = 0
$$

# Application: Causal Effects of COVID-19

## Causal Impact of COVID-19

-   The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruptions to many industries, and platform businesses, especially sharing economy platforms, are among the most disrupted ones.

-   A common data science interview question: how would you evaluate causal impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and profits?

    -   Can we collect data on the *COVID cases* and *KPI measures*, and run an OLS regression to get the causal effect? $KPI$ \~ $NumCovid$

    -   What would hinder us from causal inference from the above OLS regressions?

## Causal Impact of COVID-19 on UberEat Delivery Drivers' Labor Supply

-   In this case workshop, we will see an application of instrumental variable in evaluating the causal impact of COVID-19 on UberEat delivery drivers' labor supply decision.

-   Let's take out the Quarto document.

## Beyond the Impact of COVID-19 on Labor Supply

-   You can follow this case study and propose similar topics for your term 3 dissertation project, depending on the company you work with.

    -   The causal impact of COVID-19 on Uber/Bolt drivers' labor supply

    -   The causal impact of COVID-19 on customer demand for offline shopping

    -   etc.

-   For similar causal inference interview questions/data science tasks, when RCTs are difficult to implement, instrumental variable method can be a very powerful solution.
