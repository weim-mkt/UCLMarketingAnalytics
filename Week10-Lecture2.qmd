# Introduction to Marketing

## Week 1: Marketing Process

![](images/marketingprocess.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

## Week 1: Break-Even Analysis

-   Break-even analysis is our starting point
    -   Break-even quantity (BEQ)
    -   Net present value (NPV)
    -   Customer lifetime value (CLV)
-   BEA is essentially cost-benefit analysis
    -   Pineapple case

    -   i-basket case

# Descriptive Analytics

## Week 2: Data Wrangling with `dplyr`

-   Data manipulation with `dplyr`
    -   `filter`, `mutate`, `select`, `arrange`
    -   Group aggregation: `group_by`
    -   Dataset join: `join`
-   Tesco case study
    -   Summary statistics
    -   Preliminary customer analysis using `dplyr`

(p.s., I am super happy to see that you all have made huge progress in your R skills! **R is the best language!!!!**)

## Week 2: Preliminary Customer Analysis

-   How to design a marketing survey to collect first-hand data
    -   (debut of the first song in my first album)

# Predictive Analytics

## Week 7-9: Predictive Analytics

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = paste0(getwd(),"/images/class13_RoadMap.png"))
```

## Week 7-9: Predictive Analytics

-   Two fundamental tradeoffs in predictive analytics
    -   accuracy versus interpretability
    -   bias versus variance (underfitting versus overfitting)
-   CAC = cost per offer / *response rate*; we can use predictive analytics to conduct targeted marketing to target responsive customers
    -   RFM analysis (Week 7)
    -   Linear probability model (Week 8)
    -   Logistic regression (Week 8)
    -   Machine learning models (Week 9)
-   With targeted marketing, we can greatly boost the return on investment
    -   No model can always perform the best on all datasets
    -   It's trial and error to get the best model
    -   Automatic machine learning can save us lots of time

## Week 8: Multinomial Logit Model

-   Random utility framework and utility maximization

-   Multimonial logit model can help us understand how customers trade off between different attributes

    -   Train ticket choice (Week 8 case study)

-   Application of multinomial logit model

    -   Conjoint analysis (very powerful for understanding customers' tradeoff between product attributes)

## Week 9: Customer Relationship Management

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = paste0(getwd(),"/images/customerlifecycle.png"))
```

-   Cross-selling and up-selling
-   Churn management

# Causal Inference

## Week 5-9: Causal Inference

-   How to use **causal inference** tools to quantify the causal effect of a business campaign on business outcomes

![](images/CausalInference.png)

## Week 3: RCTs

-   Selection bias in the BMW ads case

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = paste0(getwd(),"/images/class5_BMWConversion.png"))
```

-   We can use RCT to get causal inference
    -   Core idea is to use randomization to remove selection bias

## Week 5: RCTs

-   Advantages
    -   Gold standard of causal inference;
    -   The first-best option if time and money are not a concern
-   Disadvantages
    -   Costly to run
    -   Cross-overs and spill-overs if not properly implemented
-   Application of RCTs: Vungle case study

## Week 6 & 7 : OLS Regression and Marketing Mix Modeling

-   Linear regression can give causal inference if and only if **all** confounding factors have been controlled in the regression.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="60%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = paste0(getwd(),"/images/class7_directindirecteffect.png"))
```

-   In reality, this **never happens**, so strictly speaking, linear regression can never give causal effects.

-   We can use linear regression to build marketing mix modeling, in order to set optimal prices for profit maximization.

## Week 8: Endogeneity and Instrument Variables

-   Endogeneity of simple linear regressions
    -   Omitted variable bias
    -   Reverse causality
    -   \[Measurement error\]
-   An instrument variable can give causal inference. Two requirements:
    -   Exogeneity
    -   Relevance

## Week 8: Endogeneity and Instrument Variables

-   Once we find an instrument, we can use 2-stage least square estimation to get the causal effects.

1.  Explain $X$ with $Z$ (regress $X$ on $Z$). The predicted $X$, $\hat{X}$, is uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon$ in the original regression.
    -   $\hat{X}$ is exogenous, because $Z$ is exogenous
    -   All endogenous parts are now absorbed/teased out into the error term in the first-stage regression $\epsilon_{i}$

$$
X_{i}=Z\eta+\epsilon_{i}
$$

2.  Use the explained part $\hat{X}$ to explain $y$, now $\hat{X}$ is exogenous and can give us causal inference.

$$
y_{i}=\hat{X} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(\hat{X}_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) = 0
$$

## Week 9: Difference-in-Differences

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = paste0(getwd(),"/images/class12_DiD Graph.png"))
```

We can use DiD to quantify the causal effect of:

-   A new policy/regulation (GDPR, lockdown, etc.)
-   RCTs that are hard to randamize (East London and West London case)

## Week 9: Regression Discontinuity Design

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="75%", fig.align='center'}
  include_graphics(path = paste0(getwd(),"/images/class11_RDD Example.png"))
```

We can use RDD to quantify the causal effect of:

-   "Distinction" on students' future career
-   Regression discontinuity in time

# Concluding Remarks

## MSIN0094 Contract

**I promised**

-   You will learn the state-of-the-art marketing analytics techniques that will be very helpful for your dissertation projects and future jobs.
-   You will have fun (hopefully)
-   Give you a way of thinking about Marketing Analytics that will be relevant when you need it, not just today
-   I will always be there whenever you need help.

**You promised**

-   To duly prepare for each class (if any), including the case studies and reading materials
-   To follow the code of conduct in class and in your assignments.

## Not Enough?

-   I love new challenges so my door is always open even after the class is over

-   More learning materials

    -   Handbook of Marketing Analytics: Methods and Applications in Marketing Management, Public Policy, and Litigation Support (free at UCL library)
    -   Most harmless Econometrics
    -   All optional reading materials in each week

## Lessons for Me

-   Impressed with your willingness to learn hard tools and to dig in
    -   =\> My colleagues predicted you would chase me out of the classroom for making you learn Marketing, R, and so many complicated models at the same time
-   I learned something from you too
    -   Challenge the authority
    -   Good time management
    -   Your sense of achievement is also mine

## Looking into the Future

-   The main thing you will probably remember in 10 years:
    -   There used to be a module leader with bubble tea belly, who is likely bribed by T4
    -   There used to be a lame alumnus named Tom, who claims to be Jeff Bezos' brother-in-law and made you do many assignments.

## Thank You for Being Amazing!!

**Thank you for your hard work the whole term!**

Hope in 10 years, you can still know the answer to this question!
