-   What is marketing
-   Situation analysis (5C analysis)

## Week 1: Break-Even Analysis

-   Break-even analysis is essential to any business activity
    -   Break-even quantity (BEQ)
    -   Net present value (NPV)
    -   Customer lifetime value (CLV)
-   BEA is essentially cost-benefit analysis

# Week 2: Descriptive Analytics

## Week 2: Data Wrangling with `dplyr`

-   Data manipulation with `dplyr`
    -   basic operations: `filter`, `mutate`, `select`, `arrange`
    -   group aggregation: `group_by`
    -   multi-data joining: `left_join`
-   [Tesco case study](https://weim-mkt.github.io/UCLMarketingAnalytics/Case-PreliminaryCustomerAnalysis.html): Preliminary customer analysis using `dplyr`

# Week 3-4: Predictive Analytics

![](images/PredictiveAnalyticsTypes.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}

## Week 3: Unsupervised Learning for Customer Segmentation

-   Unsupervised learning such as K-means clustering help classify individuals into different groups.
-   K-means is usually supplementary to more complicated analyses.

## Week 4: Supervised Learning for Customer Targeting

-   Supervised learning models predict outcome $Y$ based on predictors $X$
    -   linear regression (high interpretability, low accuracy)
    -   decision tree and random forest (good interpretability, good accuracy)
    -   deep learning (no interpretability, high accuracy)
-   With **targeted marketing** from supervised learning, we can effectively reduce marketing costs and boost the ROI.

# Week 5-9: Causal Inference

## Week 5: Rubin Causal Framework and RCTs

-   Why causal inference matters?

![](images/BMWConversion.png){fig-align="center" width="350"}

-   We can use RCT to get causal inference
    -   Randomization removes selection bias and pre-existing differences
-   Application of RCTs

## Week 6 & 7 : OLS Regression and Marketing Mix Modeling

-   Linear regression can give causal inference if and only if **all** confounding factors have been controlled in the regression.

![](images/directindirecteffect.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   In reality, this **never** happens, so linear regression can **never** give causal effects.

-   In practice, companies often use linear regression to build **marketing mix modeling**, in order to set optimal prices for profit maximization (profit is a quadratic function of price).

## Week 8: Endogeneity and Instrument Variables

-   Endogeneity of simple linear regressions
    -   Omitted variable bias
    -   Reverse causality
    -   \[Measurement error\]
-   An instrument variable can give causal inference. Requirements:
    -   Exogeneity
    -   Relevance
    -   Observable (implicit)

## Week 8: Endogeneity and Instrument Variables

1.  Explain $X$ with $Z$ (regress $X$ on $Z$). The predicted $X$, $\hat{X}$, is uncorrelated with the error term $\epsilon$ in the original regression.
    -   $\hat{X}$ is exogenous, because $Z$ is exogenous
    -   All endogenous parts are now absorbed/teased out into the error term in the first-stage regression $\epsilon_{i}$

$$
X_{i}=Z\eta+\epsilon_{i}
$$

2.  Use the explained part $\hat{X}$ to explain $y$, now $\hat{X}$ is exogenous and can give us causal inference.

$$
y_{i}=\hat{X} \beta+\varepsilon_{i}, \quad \operatorname{cov}\left(\hat{X}_{i}, \varepsilon_{i}\right) = 0
$$

## Week 9: Difference-in-Differences

![](images/DiDGraph.png){fig-align="center" width="200"}

-   A new policy/regulation (GDPR, lockdown, etc.)
-   RCTs that are hard to randomize at the individual level (East London and West London)

## Week 9: Regression Discontinuity Design

![](images/RDD.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   "Distinction" honor on students' future salaries
-   Regression discontinuity in time

## One Causal Question, Many Solutions

-   If we have historical data on **number of restaurants on UberEat** in each month, and **the total number of orders in each month**, can we get the causal effect?

$$
NumOrders_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 NumRestaurants_t + \epsilon_t
$$

-   Solutions
    -   RCT
    -   Instrumental Variable
    -   DiD
    -   RDD

# Concluding Remarks

## MSIN0094 Contract from Week 1

![](images/week1promise.png){fig-align="center" width="250"}

## 10 Weeks Not Enough?

-   I love new challenges so my door is always open even after the class is over

-   More learning materials

    -   Optional reading materials in each week
    -   I plan to update more R tutorials/data analytics tools on my Youtube channel. It's never too late to subscribe!

## Lessons for Me

-   Impressed with your willingness to learn hard tools and to dig in
    -   =\> My colleagues predicted you would chase me out of the classroom for making you learn Marketing, R, and so many complicated models at the same time
-   You've made me very proud:
    -   It gives me a huge sense of achievement see that you all have made huge progress in your R skills and marketing analytics models!

    -   It feels weird but I'm flattered answer questions from other modules :))

    -   **R is the best language!!!!**
-   I learned something from you too
    -   superb time management
    -   hard-working attitude

## Looking into the Future

-   The only things you will probably remember in 10 years:
    -   There used to be a module leader with a big bubble tea belly, who could have been bribed by T4
    -   but he tries his best to be a good musician, magician, youtuber, standup comedian, and most importantly a (great) lecturer
    -   There used to be a lame alumnus named Tom, who claims to be Jeff Bezos' brother-in-law and made us do many assignments.

## Thank You for Being Amazing!!

**Thank you very much for your hard work the whole term!**

Hope a few years later on a random street in London, you can still know the correct answer to this question!
