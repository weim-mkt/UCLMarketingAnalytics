# Regression Discontinuity Design

## What is an RDD

-   A **regression discontinuity design (RDD)** is a quasi-experimental design that aims to determine the causal effects of interventions by assigning a **cutoff** or **threshold** above or below which an intervention is assigned.

-   It was invented by educational psychology[^1] and generalized by economists to economics and business fields.

## Visual Illustration of RDD: An Example of Distinction on Salary

**Question**: What is the causal effect of a Distinction honor on a student's future salary?

## When to Use an RDD

-   An RDD arises when treatment is assigned based on whether an underlying **continuous** **score variable** crosses a cutoff.
    -   The characteristic is often referred to as the **running variable**.
-   **AND** the characteristic cannot be perfectly manipulated by individuals
    -   We should only focus on individuals in the neighborhood of the cutoff point.
    -   We can only estimate the **local** treatment effects from an RDD study.

## Why RDD Gives Causal Effects?

-   Because the "running variable" **cannot be perfectly controlled** by the individuals **around the cutoff point**, it's as if the treatment was randomly assigned in the neighborhood of cutoff.

-   At the same time, individuals on either side of the cut-off should be very similar to each other, such that there should be no systematic differences across the treatment and control group other than the treatment.

-   With the **treatment** being the **only discontinuity** at this threshold, a discontinuous jump in the outcome of interest at the threshold is the treatment effect.

# Steps of RDD Analyses

## Step 1: Select Sample of Analysis

1.  Determine the cutoff-point and select the subset of individuals near the cut-off point
    -   e.g., filter out students with average scores between 69 and 70

-   There is no econometric requirement on the "near"; however, we face a trade-off between external validity and internal validity:
    -   **External validity**: If we have a narrower subset of individuals, we have a smaller subset of subjects which may not be representative of remaining individuals.
    -   **Internal validity**: If we have a broader subset of individuals, it is more likely the control group and treatment group are less likely to be "as-if randomized".
-   In practice, we may need to run a set of different neighborhood bands as **robustness checks**.

## Step 2: Examine Continuity of Observed Characteristics

2.  Examine if the observed characteristics of the treatment group and control group are continuous at the cut-off point.
    -   The idea is similar to "randomization check" in the Step 5 of an RCT.

## Step 3: Analysis

3.  Regress the outcome variable on the treatment indicator to obtain the statistical significance.
    -   In R, there is also a package [`rddtools`](http://qua.st/rddtools/) which can help us estimate an RDD model.

# RDD in R

## Causal Impact of Distinction on Salaries

-   It is important to understand the causal impact of degree honors on students' future salaries and other outcomes.

-   Can we get causal inference from simple linear regression?[^2]

[^2]: Refer to html version for answers.

$$
Salary_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Distinction_i + X\beta + \epsilon_i
$$

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
-   No, because there is severe omitted variable bias. Confounding factors may include a person's ability, IQ, persistence, etc. These confounding factors are correlated with $Disinction_i$ and also affects a person's future salary. Not controlling these factors will cause omitted variable bias.
:::

## RCT, IV or DID?

-   Since **omitted variable bias** prevents us from obtaining causal inference, we need to find another causal inference tool to overcome the challenge.

-   How about

    -   RCT
    -   Instrumental Variable
    -   Difference-in-Differences

-   Fortunately, we can use **regression discontinuity design.**

## Dataset for RDD

-   To run RDD, we need to select students with very similar scores due to the tradeoff between internal validity and external validity.

    -   In the selected dataset, scores range from 69.07 to 72.93

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
load('/Users/weimiao/Dropbox/UCL/Teaching/MSIN0094 Marketing Analytics/UCL 2022 - 2023/Week 9/mlda.rda')
load('/Volumes/data HP/Dropbox/UCL/Teaching/MSIN0094 Marketing Analytics/UCL 2022 - 2023/Week 9/mlda.rda')

data_rdd <- mlda %>%
  mutate(score = agecell + 50,
         salary = all/2,
         experience = drugs,
         ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(salary))%>%
  mutate(student_id = 1:n())%>%
  select(student_id,salary,score,experience)
write.csv(data_rdd,'/Users/weimiao/Dropbox/UCL/Teaching/MSIN0094 Marketing Analytics/UCL 2022 - 2023/Week 9/data_rdd.csv', row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(data_rdd,'/Volumes/data HP/Dropbox/UCL/Teaching/MSIN0094 Marketing Analytics/UCL 2022 - 2023/Week 9/data_rdd.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
data_rdd <- read.csv('https://www.dropbox.com/s/4f0zaqqkzo0at5o/data_rdd.csv?dl=1')
head(data_rdd,5)
```

## Data Wrangling

-   To use RDD, we need to generate the treatment variable $treated$, which equals 1 if a student receives the treatment and 0 otherwise.

    -   The treatment in an RDD is in spirit similar to that of an RCT, only that the treatment is assigned by nature (hence the name "natural experiment")

```{r}
data_rdd <- data_rdd %>%
  mutate(treated = ifelse(score>=70,1,0))
```

## RDD Analysis Using R

```{r}
pacman::p_load(modelsummary,fixest)
rdd_result <- feols(
  fml = salary ~ treated,
  data = data_rdd
)
modelsummary(rdd_result,stars = TRUE)
```

## Regression Discontinuity in Time

- An event or treatment occurred at a point in time. Meanwhile, the treatment affected all individuals.
    - Because all individuals were affected, there were no control group and we could not do DiD analyses.
    
- However, if we can justify, **seasonality** is not strong within certain time window before and after the event, then we can do a **regression discontinuity in time** design (RDiT), as follows:

$$
Outcome_{i, t}=\alpha+\beta_{1} Post_{i}+X\beta + \mu_{i, t}
$$

- As we learned in DiD lecture, $\beta_1$ includes both (1) the treatment effect, and (2) seasonality
    - If the time window is short, say a few weeks before and after, it is likely seasonality effect is null, and we can claim $\beta_1$ measures the causal effect of the event.
