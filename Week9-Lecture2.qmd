# Regression Discontinuity Design

## What is an RDD

-   A **regression discontinuity design (RDD)** is a quasi-experimental design that aims to determine the causal effects of interventions by assigning a **cutoff** or **threshold** above or below which an intervention is assigned.

-   It was invented by educational psychology[^1] and generalized by economists to economics and business fields.

## When to Use an RDD

-   An RDD arises when treatment is assigned based on whether an underlying **continuous** **score variable** crosses a cutoff.
    -   The characteristic is often referred to as **running variable**.
-   **AND** the characteristic cannot be perfectly manipulated by individuals
    -   We should only focus on individuals in the neighborhood of the cutoff point
    -   We can only estimate the **local** treatment effects from an RDD study

## Why RDD Gives Causal Effects?

-   Because the "running variable" **cannot be perfectly controlled** by the individuals **around the cutoff point**, it's as if treatment were randomly assigned in the neighborhood of cutoff.

-   At the same time, individuals on either side of the cut-off should be very similar to each other, such that there should be no systematic differences across the treatment and control group other than the treatment.

-   With the **treatment** being the **only discontinuity** at this threshold, a discontinuous jump in the outcome of interest at the threshold is the treatment effect.

# Steps of RDD Analyses

## Step 1: Select Sample of Analysis

1.  Determine the cutoff-point and select the subset of individuals near the cut-off point
    -   e.g., filter out students with average scores between 69 and 70

-   There is no econometric requirement on the "near"; however, we face a trade-off between external validity and internal validity:
    -   **External validity**: If we have a narrower subset of individuals, we have a smaller subset of subjects which may not be representative of remaining subjects
    -   **Internal validity**: If we have a broader subset of individuals, it is more likely the control group and treatment group are less likely to be "as-if randomized"
-   In practice, we need to run a set of neighborhod band as **robustness checks**

## Step 2: Examine Continuity of Observed Characteristics

2.  Examine if the observed characteristics of the treatment group and control group are continuous at the cut-off point

## Step 3: Analysis

3.  Regress the outcome variable on the treatment indicator to obtain the statistical significance.
    - In R, there is also a package [`rddtools`](http://qua.st/rddtools/) which can help us estimate an RDD model.
