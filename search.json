This problem is called overfitting.\nOverfitting leads to low bias but high variance. Hence the name bias-variance tradeoff or bias-variance dilemma."

However, in fact, we do observe the actual outcomes for the test set, so that we can evaluate the prediction accuracy by comparing the predicted outcomes versus the actual outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more complicated models with hyper-parameters such as deep learning models, we may even need to split our data into 3 sets (training, validation, and test sets)."

Tom concluded that he should increase the bubble tea price in his shop so that the sales will increase accordingly.\nQuestion: What is your favoriate bubble tea flavor?"

Influencer marketing is a type of social media marketing that entails endorsements and product placement by influencers, individuals and organizations with a reputed expert degree of knowledge or social influence in their industry. Influencers are individuals who have the ability to influence others’ purchasing habits other quantifiable activities by uploading original—often sponsored—content to social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, or other social media platforms.\nThe team proposes to collaborate with the top tech influencers on Tiktok and Youtube to promote the new PinePhone 15. The one-off endorsement fee is estimated to be £50 million in total. And from historical data, the team estimates that such an influencer campaign can increase the total sales within the next financial year by 2.5%.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nBased on the information at hand, should Tom approve the influencer marketing plan?"

The current cost of financing, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), increased to 10% annually. Therefore, any marketing event is recommended to take time value of money into consideration.\nRight after the meeting, Tom asked his team for a decomposition of the predicted annual incremental sales, 2.5%, into a more granular monthly level analysis.\nThe team came back with the predicted monthly incremental sales: with influencer marketing, the first month sales will increase by 0.3% and 0.2% in the following 11 months.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nBased on the information at hand, should Tom approve the influencer marketing plan based on Net Present Value method?"

Pages 1-5 introduce the case background; pages 5-8 introduce key information to compute CLV for the company.\nWhen reading the case, please use the mind map below to find out all key information, including the variable, the value, and where it shows up in the case study. Highlight them on the PDF. This can help you quickly find that information in class.\nThink about the following questions, which we will discuss in class.\n\nWhat would be the time unit of analyses? monthly or yearly? How many years of customer’s lifetime to consider for CLV calculation? Is this reasonable?\nWhat is the information needed to calculate the net cash flows of a customer in each period? Where can you find the M and c in the CLV formula? Highlight these key numbers so that we can create them in R directly. \nHow do we incorporate customer churn in CLV calculation?\nWhat are the costs i-basket needs to incur to acquire a customer? Based on this information, how to compute the customer acquisition costs (CAC)?\nCan you figure out how to compute CLV with R even before Wednesday class? You can try your best to use what we have learned in Week 1 to compute the CLV for i-basket on your own.

    "text": "The sharing economy has been booming in recent years, leading to a rapid increase in jobs in the “gig” economy. According to Hossain (2020), in the US alone, the sharing economy sector has created 6.23 million jobs with 78 million service providers, and 800 million people engage with it. The transportation sector is one of the most salient beneficiaries of the burgeoning sharing economy. For instance, commuting to work by shared bicycle (e.g., Citi Bike) has become an increasingly popular transportation option (Ford et al. 2019). The ride-sharing service (e.g., Uber) allows drivers to enjoy more flexibility in work, which is proven valuable to drivers and has improved capacity utilization (Cramer and Krueger 2016).\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruptions to many industries, and the transportation industry is among the most disrupted ones. Further, the COVID-19 has raised concerns about the survivability of the sharing economy in general. It is reported that gross bookings on Uber rides were down by 75% in the three months through June 2020, and that Lyft’s April ridership was down by 75% from April 2019.\nUnlike the traditional taxi market, where taxi drivers rent vehicles from taxi companies and then directly provide transportation services to consumers, modern ride-sharing platforms typically serve as the matching intermediary between drivers and passengers. Due to such two-sided market nature, the profitability of modern ride-sharing platforms (and sharing economy in general) highly depends on the interdependence or externality between the two sides of economic agents (Rysman 2009). Therefore, a ride-sharing platform would benefit from the network effect if more drivers work for them. It is thus managerially important for the ride-sharing platform to understand whether COVID-19 has affected drivers’ labor supply patterns and if yes, the magnitude of the effect across drivers and over time.\nIn this case study, we will answer the above question using the instrumental variable method."

    "text": "3.1 Key Outcome Variables\nTo facilitate the empirical analysis of drivers’ responses to COVID-19, the data science team has followed the literature (e.g., Farber 2008) and further aggregate trips into a higher level for each driver so that we can measure both extensive margin (i.e., whether to work) and intensive margin (i.e., how much to work) of drivers’ labor supply. As the COVID-19 measures vary at the daily level, the team aggregated the trip level data into driver-day level. Specifically, Uber cares about the following driver-day level KPI measures which serve as the dependent variables in the subsequent empirical analysis.\n\nWhether or not to work, a binary outcome variable which equals 1 if a driver has at least one ride request on the day and 0 otherwise. We can use this variable to measure drivers’ shift decision, i.e., willingness to work on a day, which proxies for the extensive margin of drivers’ labor supply. It is ambiguous ex-ante how the number of new cases affects a driver’s shift decision. On the one hand, more new cases may increase the risk of infection, which decease drivers’ expected wellbeing, and therefore discourage drivers from working on a specific day; on the other hand, fewer drivers on the street suggest less competition among drivers and therefore higher chances of getting a passenger and potentially higher hourly earnings, which may motivate drivers to work. It is important for the ride-sharing company to understand how the severity of COVID-19 affects drivers’ willingness to work, so that the company can adjust their stimulus plans for drivers accordingly.\nTotal number of completed orders, which contain three aspects of information which are of policy and managerial interest. First, the variable can proxy for the length of drivers’ daily labor supply. Conditional on working, if a driver decides to work for longer hours, then we expect the driver to have a larger number of requests/orders. Second, both variables contain information on consumer demand. We expect the total number of requests/orders to decrease if there is a lower demand for ride-sharing service from consumers due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Finally, both variables can measure the intensity of competition among drivers. Keeping the level of demand fixed, the total number of requests/orders would be larger when there are fewer drivers working on the day. Due to the complexity of information contained, ex-ante, it is not straightforward how the COVID-19 measures affect the total number of orders for individual drivers.\nEarnings. Earnings measure the driver’s income from providing ride-sharing services, which is highly correlated with the number of completed orders and total trip distance. It allows us to directly assess the impact of the COVID-19 on drivers’ financial wellbeing.\nAverage trip distance. In our empirical context, drivers cannot reject a booking request once being matched with a passenger, therefore, the trip distance is largely determined by passengers. Since passengers may be reluctant to take long distance trips during the pandemic, we expect a negative impact of the number of new cases on the average trip distance."

    "text": "3.3 Fixed Effect OLS Regressions\nWhat confounding factors do we need to control in the above OLS regressions? Specifically, since this data is a panel data, what fixed effects do you need to control in the OLS regression?\nWe first need to include driver fixed effects to control for driver-specific characteristics that may affect drivers’ labor supply patterns. Such characteristics include, but are not limited to, the driver’s sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., gender and age), the driver’s degree of risk aversion, whether a driver is driving full-time or part-time, and the driver’s innate abilities to search for passengers, etc.\nFor instance, less risk-averse drivers may prefer to work on days when there are more new cases because they expect less competition from peer drivers and potentially higher profitability on such days. Another example is that, full-time drivers can be more subject to the impact of new cases compared to part-time drivers, because full-time drivers’ income largely comes from providing ride-sharing services via the focal company. Driver fixed effects can mitigate such driver-specific time-invariant confounding effects and help us obtain more accurate estimates for our focal explanatory variable NewCases.\nIn addition to driver fixed effects that remove cross-sectional confounding effects across drivers, we also include time fixed effects in Equation (1) to mitigate the intertemporal confounding effects. We consider time fixed effects at the day level. Moreover, given that the local government in each city may have enacted different policies on fighting COVID-19 and/or stimulating economy (e.g., subsidizing drivers) during our data period, we further control for city fixed effects.\n\nFE_is_work &lt;- feols(fml = is_work ~ new_cases|\n                       driver_id + booking_date + city,\n      data = data_driver)\nFE_income &lt;- feols(fml = income ~ new_cases|\n                       driver_id + booking_date + city,\n      data = data_driver)\nFE_n_order &lt;- feols(fml = n_order ~ new_cases|\n                       driver_id + booking_date + city,\n      data = data_driver)\nFE_avg_distance &lt;- feols(fml = avg_distance ~ new_cases|\n                       driver_id + booking_date + city,\n      data = data_driver)\n\nmodelsummary(list(FE_is_work,FE_income,FE_n_order,FE_avg_distance),\n             stars = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nModel 1\nModel 2\nModel 3\nModel 4\n\n\n\n\nnew_cases\n0.0002\n0.029\n0.003\n0.002\n\n\n\n(0.0005)\n(0.022)\n(0.003)\n(0.008)\n\n\nNum.Obs.\n93467\n93467\n93467\n93467\n\n\nR2\n0.662\n0.555\n0.607\n0.420\n\n\nR2 Adj.\n0.650\n0.539\n0.593\n0.400\n\n\nR2 Within\n0.000001\n0.00001\n0.000007\n0.0000006\n\n\nR2 Within Adj.\n−0.00001\n−0.0000009\n−0.000004\n−0.00001\n\n\nRMSE\n0.22\n13.79\n1.85\n3.84\n\n\nStd.Errors\nby: driver_id\nby: driver_id\nby: driver_id\nby: driver_id\n\n\nFE: driver_id\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nFE: booking_date\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nFE: city\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\n + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001"

On the one hand, drivers may adjust their labor supply accordingly to the number of new cases. On the other hand, prior research has demonstrated the potential effect of mobility on the COVID-19 case growth rate. If a city has a higher volume of private transportation through ride-sharing services, given the highly contagious nature of COVID-19, the city may have a higher number of new cases."

We can potentially select two instrumental variables. The first instrumental variable is imported new cases, which measures the number of infected travelers from overseas in each city as disclosed by local government. Because the imported cases relate to travelers from overseas, it should be exogenous to local confirmed cases and meet the exogeneity requirement. The second instrumental variable is other city new cases, which is the number of new cases confirmed in neighboring cities. Since confirmed cases in other cities should not directly affect the focal city’s ride-sharing market, the variable other city new cases should also satisfy the exogeneity requirement."

The Research and Development (R&D) costs for PinePhone 15 is 100 million pounds.\nBased on the above information, we first translate the necessary background information into the following R objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning Operations\n\n\n\n\nWhen assigning values to variables, the operation will not print the values of the new variable\nIf you would like to check the variable is created with the correct value, you can\n\ncheck its value in the RStudio Environment on the right hand side\nin a new line, type the variable name: this is to ask R to print out the value of the object\n\n\n\n\n\n# translate the above information into R variables\nprice &lt;- 600 # retail price\nquantity &lt;- 10 # sales \nCOGS &lt;- 0.6 # cost of goods sold\nRD_costs &lt;- 100 # Research and Development costs\nendorsement_fee &lt;- 50 # endorsement\nendorsement_sales_increase &lt;- 0.025\n\n\nQuestion 1\nCompute the contribution margin per unit\n\n# Create a variable called contribution_margin from price and COGS\n# Use variables but not the raw numbers. --- Why?\n\n# Following the definition of contribution margin per unit: price - cost\ncontribution_margin &lt;- price - price * COGS\ncontribution_margin\n\n[1] 240\n\n\n\n# equivalently, contribution margin per unit = price * contribution margin rate  \ncontribution_margin &lt;- price * (1 - COGS) \ncontribution_margin\n\n[1] 240\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\nBased on the information at hand, should Tom approve the influencer marketing plan?\nTo decide whether Tom should approve the marketing plan, we need to conduct break-even analyses.\nThe first step is to compute the break-even quantity, as shown in the following code.\n\n# numerator is the marketing expense\n# denominator is the \"extra profit\", or the contribution margin, from selling one more unit\nBEQ &lt;- endorsement_fee / contribution_margin\nBEQ\n\n[1] 0.2083333\n\n\nBreak even quantity is the incremental quantity sales needed in order to neither lose money nor make money from the marketing campaign, hence the name “break-even”. This is like the safe line the campaign must reach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales\n\n\n\nIn this module (and in practice), when we talk about sales, we mean the quantity sales, the number of units sold. For instance, in the case study, the original sales without influencer marketing is 10 million units.\nThe total money made is often called revenue or revenue sales. For instance, in the case study, the original revenue is 6000 million pounds.\n\n\nThe next step is to compare BEQ with the estimated incremental sales from the campaign.\nBEQ is 0.208 million units, which is smaller than incremental sales is 10 * 0.025 million units. It means, to not lose any money, the influencer marketing compaign needs to bring in additional 0.208 million units, but in reality, the company can actually sell better at 0.25 million, so it’s profitable to continue with the influencer marketing campaign.\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, Tom should approve the influencer marketing campaign.\n\n\nQuestion 3\n(Please follow the above example to finish both authoring and R codes for the NPV question)\n\nCompute the sequence of monthly cash flows\n\n\nFirst, we compute the incremental sales percentage for each month, relative to the 10 million. This is a 12-element vector, each element representing the incremental sales percentage.\n\n\nincremental.sales.percentage_1stmonth &lt;- 0.003\nincremental.sales.percentage_next11months &lt;- rep(0.002,11)\n\n# incremental profit each month\nvector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months &lt;- c(incremental.sales.percentage_1stmonth,incremental.sales.percentage_next11months)\n\nvector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months\n\n [1] 0.003 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002\n\n\n\nNext, we time the incremental sales percentage with quantity, to get the incremental sales in terms of units each month.\n\n\nvector_incremental.sales.units_12months &lt;- vector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months * quantity\n\nvector_incremental.sales.units_12months\n\n [1] 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02\n\n\n\nLastly, we multiply the incremental quantity sales with the contribution margin per unit, to get the total contribution margins (incremental profits) for each month, i.e., the CF\n\n\nvector_CF &lt;- vector_incremental.sales.units_12months * contribution_margin\n\nvector_CF\n\n [1] 7.2 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8\n\n\n\nCompute the sequence of discount factors\n\n\n# divide annual wacc to get monthly wacc\nmonthly_WACC &lt;- 0.1/12 \n\n# discount factor for 1 month is 1/(1+k)\ndiscount_factor &lt;- 1/ (1+monthly_WACC)\n\n# Generate a geometric sequence vector of discounted CFs for 12 months\n\nvector_discount_factor &lt;- discount_factor ^ c(1:12)\n\nvector_discount_factor\n\n [1] 0.9917355 0.9835394 0.9754110 0.9673497 0.9593551 0.9514265 0.9435635\n [8] 0.9357654 0.9280319 0.9203622 0.9127559 0.9052124\n\n\n\nCompute the NPV\n\n\nMultiply CF vector with discount factor vector, to get the discounted CF vector\n\n\nvector_discounted.CF &lt;- vector_CF * vector_discount_factor \n  \nvector_discounted.CF\n\n [1] 7.140496 4.720989 4.681973 4.643279 4.604904 4.566847 4.529105 4.491674\n [9] 4.454553 4.417738 4.381228 4.345020\n\n\n\nuse function sum() to get the sum of all elements in a vector.

Your intuition is likely correct! The reason is that the default R distributions from CRAN make use of the default BLAS/LAPACK implementation for linear algebra operations. The purpose of using such reference BLAS libraries by the development team is good: These implementations are built to be stable and cross platform compatible. However, the price that comes with stability is the sacrifice of speed. Is there a way to tweak your R settings to significantly boost the running speed? The answer is yes, and the steps are actually quite simple. We will review the steps to install highly optimized libraries and benchmark their performance."

    "text": "Marketing research has traditionally focused on causal inference. The focus on causation stems from the need to make counterfactual predictions. For example, will increasing advertising expenditure increase demand? Answering this question requires an unbiased estimate of advertising impact on demand. However, the need to make accurate predictions is also important to marketing practices. For example, which consumers to target, which product configuration a consumer is most likely to choose, which version of a banner advertisement will generate more clicks, and what the market shares and actions of competitors are likely to be. All of these are prediction problems. These problems do not require causation; rather, they require models with high out-of-sample predictive accuracy. Predictive analytics (machine learning, ML) tools can address these types of problems.\nMachine learning (ML) refers to the study of methods or algorithms designed to learn the underlying patterns in the data and make predictions based on these patterns. A key characteristic of predictive analytics techniques is their ability to produce accurate out-of-sample predictions. Consider the problem of predicting whether a user will click on an ad. We do not have a comprehensive theory of users’ clicking behavior. Predictive analytics methods can automatically learn which of these factors affect user behavior and how they interact with each other, potentially in a highly non-linear fashion, to derive the best functional form that explains user behavior virtually in real time. Predictive analytics methods typically assume a model or structure to learn, but they use a general class of models that can be very rich.\nPredictive analytics models can be divided into two groups: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning requires input data that has both predictor (independent) variables and a target (dependent) variable whose value is to be estimated. If the goal of an analysis is to predict the value of some variable (e.g., whether customer responds to our marketing offers; whether customers churn at some point in time), then supervised learning is used.\nOn the other hand, unsupervised learning does not identify a target (dependent) variable, but rather treats all of the variables equally. In this case, the goal is not to predict the value of a variable, but rather to look for patterns, groupings, or other ways to characterize the data that may lead to an understanding of the way the data interrelate. Cluster analysis is an example of unsupervised learning, which helps data analysts find customer segments based on provided characteristics.\nIn this case study, we are going to analyze the same dataset as in “Preliminary Customer Analysis”. Our task is to use predictive analytics tools to help Tesco conduct more effective targeted marketing.\nAs a quick recap, the variable definitions are as follows:\nDemographic Variables\n\nID: Customer’s unique identifier\nYear_Birth: Customer’s birth year\nEducation: Customer’s education level\nMarital_Status: Customer’s marital status\nIncome: Customer’s yearly household income\nKidhome: Number of children in customer’s household\nTeenhome: Number of teenagers in customer’s household\nDt_Customer: Date of customer’s enrollment with the company\n\nCustomer Purchase History Data\n\nID: Customer’s unique identifier\nMntWines: Amount spent on wine in last 2 years\nMntFruits: Amount spent on fruits in last 2 years\nMntMeatProducts: Amount spent on meat in last 2 years\nMntFishProducts: Amount spent on fish in last 2 years\nMntSweetProducts: Amount spent on sweets in last 2 years\nNumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases made with a discount\nNumWebPurchases: Number of purchases made through the company’s web site\nNumCatalogPurchases: Number of purchases made using a catalogue\nNumStorePurchases: Number of purchases made directly in stores\nNumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to company’s web site in the last month\nComplain: 1 if customer complained in the last 2 years, 0 otherwise\nResponse: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise\nRecency: Number of days since customer’s last purchase"

It does Tesco no good from sending offers to those customers who would not respond anyway.\nHowever, if Tesco uses the trained decision tree model to conduct targeted marketing, and only target those customers who are predicted to be more responsive than the break-even response rate by decision trees, what would happen to the ROI?\n\n\n3.5.2 Predict response rate from decision tree model\nFirst, we have already trained the decision tree model, named decision_tree, from the training set. We can predict the probability of test set customer responding to our marketing offer, using predict().\n\n# use predict() to make prediction on the test set\n# Note that prediction_from_decision_tree is already a vector,\n# which we can directly mutate into \nprediction_from_decision_tree &lt;- predict(decision_tree, data_test)\n\n# mutate a new column in data_test for the predicted probability\ndata_test &lt;- data_test %&gt;%\n  mutate(predicted_prob_decisiontree = prediction_from_decision_tree)\n\nTasks: We should only send marketing offers to consumers whose expected or predicted response rate is larger than the break-even response rate. This is called targeted marketing.\n\n# mutate a new binary indicator for whether to target a customer based on predicted prob from decision tree model\ndata_test &lt;- data_test %&gt;%\n  mutate(is_target_decisiontree = ifelse(predicted_prob_decisiontree &gt; break_even_response,1L,0L))\n\nFinally, we have decided to send marketing offers to selected responsive customers. We can then compute the ROI for targeted marketing as in the blanket marketing case.\n\n# total marketing costs\ntotal_costs_of_mailing_decisiontree &lt;- cost_per_offer * sum(data_test$is_target_decisiontree)\n\n# total profits from responding customers\ntotal_profit_decisiontree &lt;- sum((data_test%&gt;%filter(is_target_decisiontree==1))$Response) * profit_per_customer\n\n# Compute ROI\nROI_decisiontree&lt;- (total_profit_decisiontree - total_costs_of_mailing_decisiontree)/total_costs_of_mailing_decisiontree\n\nROI_decisiontree\n\n[1] 0.8550725\n\n\nIf Tesco uses random forest, an arguably better supervised learning model, to conduct targeted marketing, we can follow a similar logic as above, and compute the ROI from using random forest.\n\n# mutate a new binary indicator for whether to target a customer based on predicted prob from random forest model\ndata_test &lt;- data_test %&gt;%\n  mutate(is_target_randomforest = ifelse(predicted_prob_randomforest &gt; break_even_response,1,0))\n\n# total marketing costs\ntotal_costs_of_mailing_randomforest &lt;- cost_per_offer * sum(data_test$is_target_randomforest)\n\n# total profits from responding customers\ntotal_profit_randomforest &lt;- sum((data_test%&gt;%filter(is_target_randomforest==1))$Response) * profit_per_customer\n\n# Compute ROI\nROI_randomforest&lt;- (total_profit_randomforest - total_costs_of_mailing_randomforest)/total_costs_of_mailing_randomforest\n\nROI_randomforest\n\n[1] 1.031746\n\n\nPredictive analytics model can help the company boost the marketing ROI by allowing Tesco to target customers who are more likely to respond to the marketing offers than the break-even response rate. By doing so, Tesco saves unnecessary marketing costs on those unresponsive customers and therefore improves its marketing efficiency."

    "text": "The amount of data created worldwide has been increasing exponentially over the past decade with some estimates placing the total at 59 zettabytes as of 2020 (Statista 2020). Data without analytics, however, is of little value to business decision-makers aiming to improve performance and increase growth. It is therefore no surprise that top-tier consulting companies, analytics ﬁrms and business schools have been promoting the positive returns to greater usage of analytics technology. It also explains why an increasing number of data analytics enthusiasts are willing to pay up to £40k tuition fee (that is 10,000 bubble teas!) to join the prestigious MSc Business Analytics program at the UCL School of Management (hmm, it’s now already week 3, too late to ask David for a refund!).\nBy identifying patterns and trends in massive amounts of data, business analytics enables organizations to make better decisions and improve performance. Descriptive analytics is the simplest and most widely used type of analytics; it is used to generate key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for business reports and dashboards. The latest research shows that, even with the adoption of very simple descriptive analytics, businesses can improve their performance by a large extent — Berman and Israeli (2022) use the synthetic difference-in-differences method to analyze the staggered adoption of a retail analytics dashboard by more than 1,500 e-commerce websites,1 and find an increase of 4%–10% in average weekly revenues post-adoption. The increase in revenue is not explained by price changes or advertising optimization. Instead, it is consistent with the addition of customer relationship management, personalization, and prospecting technologies to retailer websites. The adoption and usage of descriptive analytics also increases the diversity of products sold, the number of transactions, the numbers of website visitors and unique customers, and the revenue from repeat customers. These findings are consistent with a complementary effect of descriptive analytics that serve as a monitoring device that helps retailers control additional martech tools and amplify their value. Without using the descriptive dashboard, retailers are unable to reap the benefits associated with these technologies.\nIn practice, businesses use descriptive analytics to assess how well they are performing and if they are on pace to meet business objectives. Business leaders and financial specialists monitor common financial measures generated by descriptive analytics, such as revenue and spending growth on a regular basis. Marketing teams utilize descriptive analytics to analyze the efficacy of marketing campaigns by tracking data such as conversion rates and social media followers, and manage customer relationship by keeping track of customer lifetime values. Manufacturing organizations track indicators such as line throughput and downtime. Descriptive analytics enables everyone in the organization to make more informed decisions that move the business forward. It reveals trends that would otherwise remain buried in raw data, allowing marketing managers to quickly assess how well the firm is operating and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, descriptive analytics enables firms to convey information within departments and to external parties.\nIn the remaining of this case, we will explore (1) how to consolidate multiple databases from various sources using R and (2) how to conduct preliminary customer analysis using descriptive analytics."

    "text": "2.1 Demographic Information\nKnowing your consumer is a vital concept of running any business. Is the business selling fertilizer to farmers, apparel to teenage girls, or vacations to senior citizens? The distinctions are readily apparent in this comparison.\nDemographics define the qualities of clients. To be successful, business owners must understand the demographics of their clients and the trends or changes that are occurring within those specific traits.\nThe following demographic information is usually of interest to business managers:\nAge: Consumer behavior is strongly influenced by age. Younger consumers are more affluent and willing to spend more on entertainment, fashion, and movies. Seniors spend less on these items; they are less active, spend more time indoors, and require more medical treatment. Additionally, market segments can be defined by age groups. For instance, digital devices such as iPhones are targeted more towards millennials than at seniors. While older adults are increasingly utilizing technology, they remain less digitally savvy than millennials and purchase fewer digital products.\nGender: Gender also matters. Males and females have vastly diverse demands and tastes, which influence their purchasing decisions. As a result, some products are created with a specific gender in mind. Macy’s, Nordstrom, and The Gap all have departments dedicated to teenage girls’ clothes, while Seiko has a specific line of diver watches for men only.\nIncome: Income has a substantial influence on consumer behavior and product purchases. Middle-income customers make purchases with due regard for the utility of money. They do not have unlimited money to spend, and hence the money spent on one item may be used on something else. On the other hand, consumers with higher incomes tend to be less price sensitive and have a higher willingness to pay.\nEducation: Consumers’ level of education has an effect on their impressions of the world around them and on the amount of research they conduct prior to making a purchase. Individuals with a higher level of education will spend more time educating themselves before investing their money. Education has an impact on fashion, film, and television programming. Consumers with a higher level of education can be more distrustful of commercials and the facts offered.\nTesco has collected rich customer demographic information through its loyalty program, Tesco Clubcard membership. In the demograhpics.csv dataset, the data scientist team has the following demographic variables:\n\nID: Customer’s unique identifier\nYear_Birth: Customer’s birth year\nEducation: Customer’s education level\nMarital_Status: Customer’s marital status\nIncome: Customer’s yearly household income\nKidhome: Number of children in customer’s household\nTeenhome: Number of teenagers in customer’s household\nDt_Customer: Date of customer’s enrollment with the company"

This sentiment is especially true for marketing managers, where a consumer’s purchase history provides invaluable insight into their future purchasing habits.\nTesco’s data engineering team has assembled a cross-sectional customer purchase history data, with variables including\n\nID: Customer’s unique identifier\nMntWines: Amount spent on wine in last 2 years\nMntFruits: Amount spent on fruits in last 2 years\nMntMeatProducts: Amount spent on meat in last 2 years\nMntFishProducts: Amount spent on fish in last 2 years\nMntSweetProducts: Amount spent on sweets in last 2 years\nNumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases made with a discount\nNumWebPurchases: Number of purchases made through the company’s web site\nNumCatalogPurchases: Number of purchases made using a catalogue\nNumStorePurchases: Number of purchases made directly in stores\nNumWebVisitsMonth: Number of visits to company’s web site in the last month\nComplain: 1 if customer complained in the last 2 years, 0 otherwise\nResponse: 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise\nRecency: Number of days since customer’s last purchase"

    "text": "5.1 Why do we need to install Rtools and Commandline tools?\nMany R packages are written in R. Since R is an interpreted language, source code written in R doesn’t have to be translated into system-specific machine language before running. However, some R packages have significant portions written in compiled languages, such as C/C++ or Fortran. These languages need accessory software tools to translate (“compile”) their source code into machine language that can run on a particular system.\nPackage developers have two choices when distributing code for compiled languages:\n\nThey can prepare compiled, realdy-to-use “binaries” matched against common systems, so that people can simply download the binaries and directly use their packages code without having to know how to compile it.\nThey can distribute source code (i.e., the raw C++ codes) only, and expect the user to have the right compiler software to build system-specific runnable code themselves. Rtools and Commandline tools are the compliers that do the job, therefore needed as an additional installation step.\n\nOn UNIX/Linux, only source code is distributed and all packages are compiled from source during installation (for packages written entirely in R, this is trivial!). For Windows and Mac, CRAN makes pre-compiled binaries available. On Windows, install.packages() will only install precompiled binaries, unless explicitly forced to install from source (you can read a lot more about this in the R Installation and Administration guide)."
