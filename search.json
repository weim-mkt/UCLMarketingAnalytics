For instance, a vector can store the income of a group of people, the final grades of students, etc.\nVector can be created using the function c() by listing all the values in the parenthesis, separated by comma ‘,’.\nc() stands for “combine”.\n\n\nIncome &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 10)\nIncome\n\n[1]  1  3  5 10\n\n\n\nVectors must contain elements of the same data type.

The earliest known European printed book is a Quarto, the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Johannes Gutenberg in 1452–53.”↩︎\nYou can also use equal sign =, but it’s recommended to stick with R’s tradition.↩︎",

Pages 1-5 introduce the case background; pages 5-8 introduce key information to compute CLV for the company.\nWhen reading the case, please use the mind map below to find out all key information, including the variable, the value, and where it shows up in the case study. Highlight them on the PDF. This can help you quickly find that information in class.\nThink about the following questions, which we will discuss in class.\n\nWhat would be the time unit of analyses? monthly or yearly? How many years of customer’s lifetime to consider for CLV calculation? Is this reasonable?\nWhat is the information needed to calculate the net cash flows of a customer in each period? Where can you find the M and c in the CLV formula? Highlight these key numbers so that we can create them in R directly. \nHow do we incorporate customer churn in CLV calculation?\nWhat are the costs i-basket needs to incur to acquire a customer? Based on this information, how to compute the customer acquisition costs (CAC)?\nCan you figure out how to compute CLV with R even before Wednesday class? You can try your best to use what we have learned in Week 1 to compute the CLV for i-basket on your own.

For instance, in the case study, the original sales without influencer marketing is 10 million units.\nThe total money made is often called revenue or revenue sales. For instance, in the case study, the original revenue is 6000 million pounds.\n\n\nThe next step is to compare BEQ with the estimated incremental sales from the campaign.\nBEQ is 0.208 million units, which is smaller than incremental sales is 10 * 0.025 million units. It means, to not lose any money, the influencer marketing compaign needs to bring in additional 0.208 million units, but in reality, the company can actually sell better at 0.25 million, so it’s profitable to continue with the influencer marketing campaign.\nTherefore, based on the above reasoning, Tom should approve the influencer marketing campaign.\n\n\nQuestion 3\n(Please follow the above example to finish both authoring and R codes for the NPV question)\n\nCompute the sequence of monthly cash flows\n\n\nFirst, we compute the incremental sales percentage for each month, relative to the 10 million. This is a 12-element vector, each element representing the incremental sales percentage.\n\n\nincremental.sales.percentage_1stmonth &lt;- 0.003\nincremental.sales.percentage_next11months &lt;- rep(0.002,11)\n\n# incremental profit each month\nvector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months &lt;- c(incremental.sales.percentage_1stmonth,incremental.sales.percentage_next11months)\n\nvector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months\n\n [1] 0.003 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002 0.002\n\n\n\nNext, we time the incremental sales percentage with quantity, to get the incremental sales in terms of units each month.\n\n\nvector_incremental.sales.units_12months &lt;- vector_incremental.sales.percentage_12months * quantity\n\nvector_incremental.sales.units_12months\n\n [1] 0.03 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02 0.02\n\n\n\nLastly, we multiply the incremental quantity sales with the contribution margin per unit, to get the total contribution margins (incremental profits) for each month, i.e., the CF\n\n\nvector_CF &lt;- vector_incremental.sales.units_12months * contribution_margin\n\nvector_CF\n\n [1] 7.2 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8\n\n\n\nCompute the sequence of discount factors\n\n\n# divide annual wacc to get monthly wacc\nmonthly_WACC &lt;- 0.1/12 \n\n# discount factor for 1 month is 1/(1+k)\ndiscount_factor &lt;- 1/ (1+monthly_WACC)\n\n# Generate a geometric sequence vector of discounted CFs for 12 months\n\nvector_discount_factor &lt;- discount_factor ^ c(1:12)\n\nvector_discount_factor\n\n [1] 0.9917355 0.9835394 0.9754110 0.9673497 0.9593551 0.9514265 0.9435635\n [8] 0.9357654 0.9280319 0.9203622 0.9127559 0.9052124\n\n\n\nCompute the NPV\n\n\nMultiply CF vector with discount factor vector, to get the discounted CF vector\n\n\nvector_discounted.CF &lt;- vector_CF * vector_discount_factor \n  \nvector_discounted.CF\n\n [1] 7.140496 4.720989 4.681973 4.643279 4.604904 4.566847 4.529105 4.491674\n [9] 4.454553 4.417738 4.381228 4.345020\n\n\n\nuse function sum() to get the sum of all elements in a vector.

    "text": "If your codes include lots of vector/matrix operations, especially those computation intensive tasks such as matrix inverse,1 you will probably feel that the default R is slow. Your intuition is likely correct! The reason is that the default R distributions from CRAN make use of the default BLAS/LAPACK implementation for linear algebra operations. The purpose of using such reference BLAS libraries by the development team is good: These implementations are built to be stable and cross platform compatible. However, the price that comes with stability is the sacrifice of speed. Is there a way to tweak your R settings to significantly boost the running speed? The answer is yes, and the steps are actually quite simple. We will review the steps to install highly optimized libraries and benchmark their performance.",

    "text": "5.1 Why do we need to install Rtools and Commandline tools?\nMany R packages are written in R. Since R is an interpreted language, source code written in R doesn’t have to be translated into system-specific machine language before running. However, some R packages have significant portions written in compiled languages, such as C/C++ or Fortran. These languages need accessory software tools to translate (“compile”) their source code into machine language that can run on a particular system.\nPackage developers have two choices when distributing code for compiled languages:\n\nThey can prepare compiled, realdy-to-use “binaries” matched against common systems, so that people can simply download the binaries and directly use their packages code without having to know how to compile it.\nThey can distribute source code (i.e., the raw C++ codes) only, and expect the user to have the right compiler software to build system-specific runnable code themselves. Rtools and Commandline tools are the compliers that do the job, therefore needed as an additional installation step.\n\nOn UNIX/Linux, only source code is distributed and all packages are compiled from source during installation (for packages written entirely in R, this is trivial!). For Windows and Mac, CRAN makes pre-compiled binaries available. On Windows, install.packages() will only install precompiled binaries, unless explicitly forced to install from source (you can read a lot more about this in the R Installation and Administration guide).",

Meanwhile, the good news is that the Bank of England has announced a 0.5% decrease in the base interest rate, which will reduce the cost of financing for Apple Inc.\nThe current cost of financing, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), increased to 10% annually. Therefore, any marketing event is recommended to take time value of money into consideration.\nRight after the meeting, Tom asked his team for a decomposition of the predicted annual incremental sales, 2.5%, into a more granular monthly level analysis.\nThe team came back with the predicted monthly incremental sales: with influencer marketing, the first month sales will increase by 0.3% and 0.2% in the following 11 months.\n\nQuestion 3:\n\nBased on the information at hand, should Tom approve the influencer marketing plan based on Net Present Value method?",
