For instance, a vector can store the income of a group of people, the final grades of students, etc.\nVector can be created using the function c() by listing all the values in the parenthesis, separated by comma ‘,’.\nc() stands for “combine”.\n\n\nIncome &lt;- c(1, 3, 5, 10)\nIncome\n\n[1]  1  3  5 10\n\n\n\nVectors must contain elements of the same data type.

    "text": "5.1 Why do we need to install Rtools and Commandline tools?\nMany R packages are written in R. Since R is an interpreted language, source code written in R doesn’t have to be translated into system-specific machine language before running. However, some R packages have significant portions written in compiled languages, such as C/C++ or Fortran. These languages need accessory software tools to translate (“compile”) their source code into machine language that can run on a particular system.\nPackage developers have two choices when distributing code for compiled languages:\n\nThey can prepare compiled, realdy-to-use “binaries” matched against common systems, so that people can simply download the binaries and directly use their packages code without having to know how to compile it.\nThey can distribute source code (i.e., the raw C++ codes) only, and expect the user to have the right compiler software to build system-specific runnable code themselves. Rtools and Commandline tools are the compliers that do the job, therefore needed as an additional installation step.\n\nOn UNIX/Linux, only source code is distributed and all packages are compiled from source during installation (for packages written entirely in R, this is trivial!). For Windows and Mac, CRAN makes pre-compiled binaries available. On Windows, install.packages() will only install precompiled binaries, unless explicitly forced to install from source (you can read a lot more about this in the R Installation and Administration guide)."

    "text": "If your codes include lots of vector/matrix operations, especially those computation intensive tasks such as matrix inverse,1 you will probably feel that the default R is slow. Your intuition is likely correct! The reason is that the default R distributions from CRAN make use of the default BLAS/LAPACK implementation for linear algebra operations. The purpose of using such reference BLAS libraries by the development team is good: These implementations are built to be stable and cross platform compatible. However, the price that comes with stability is the sacrifice of speed. Is there a way to tweak your R settings to significantly boost the running speed? The answer is yes, and the steps are actually quite simple. We will review the steps to install highly optimized libraries and benchmark their performance.",

    "text": "We will have a 3-hour session each week and I will aim to cover a new marketing analytics model. Whenever we learn a new technique (e.g., a new statistical model or a new analytics tool), the subsequent week will often start with some warm-up exercise and a seminar workshop (with a case study) for you to review and practice the new technique learned in the previous week. This way, you would have time to digest what you’ve learned and can further reflect on your understanding of the technique by practicing your skills with a real-life application.\nFor instance, in week 1, I will first introduce the concepts of marketing and marketing process, and then will cover the concept of customer lifetime value (CLV) and how to compute CLV with R. In week 2, we will therefore begin with a case study that helps you practice your knowledge of CLV, so you can understand how to use CLV for better marketing decisions in your future projects/jobs.\nIn the remaining time of week 2, I will then introduce a new technique: the dplyr package in R, which helps us clean and manipulate datasets in R. Following a similar logic, then in week 3, we will start with a case study for you to practice the dplyr package. So on and so forth.",

Pages 1-5 introduce the case background; pages 5-8 introduce key information to compute CLV for the company.\nWhen reading the case, please use the mind map below to find out all key information, including the variable, the value, and where it shows up in the case study. Highlight them on the PDF. This can help you quickly find that information in class.\nThink about the following questions, which we will discuss in class.\n\nWhat would be the time unit of analyses? monthly or yearly? How many years of customer’s lifetime to consider for CLV calculation? Is this reasonable?\nWhat is the information needed to calculate the net cash flows of a customer in each period? Where can you find the M and c in the CLV formula? Highlight these key numbers so that we can create them in R directly. \nHow do we incorporate customer churn in CLV calculation?\nWhat are the costs i-basket needs to incur to acquire a customer? Based on this information, how to compute the customer acquisition costs (CAC)?\nCan you figure out how to compute CLV with R even before Wednesday class? You can try your best to use what we have learned in Week 1 to compute the CLV for i-basket on your own.
