## Textbook

-   We will not rely on any specific textbook in this module.
    -   ["Handbook of Marketing Analytics"](https://ucl-new-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/5qfvbu/UCL_LMS_DS51237610180004761). This book is free for download at UCL's E-library.
    -   ["Introduction to Econometrics with R"](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html), which is a good textbook for learning econometrics with R.
-   All classes will be based on the lecture notes and supplementary readings I have prepared for you.

## Lecture Notes and How to Prepare

-   I'm updating my Lecture notes every year to keep up with the latest development in marketing analytics. So lecture notes will be released each week before the lecture.
    -   **PDF version** includes the slides you see now
    -   **html version** additionally includes the solution R codes for in-class questions
-   For each week's class, there may be **pre-class preparation** needed
    -   Materials will be posted under each week's Moodle section with instructions
    -   These are **mandatory**, usually involves reading case studies necessary for class discussion
-   There are also supplementary **after-class reading/exercise** to further enhance your understanding

## Module Communications and Any Questions

-   We will use **Microsoft Teams** for all communications of this module. Please use the code to join the MS Team now.

-   Make sure you hit "**Change Notifications =\> All Activities**" for all channels, especially the **General** Channel where important module announcements will be made.

-   For any questions you have, please post them in the corresponding Teams channel first, so that everyone can see the question.

    -   We have separate channels for assignments, lectures, and R programming questions.

-   The teaching team will monitor the channel and answer them.

## Still Have Questions? Use Office Hours

-   Office hour sessions will be hosted on **MS Teams** each Tuesday by TAs and Friday by me.

-   The links to book office hours are below (also under Moodle's "`Module Overview`" Section for easier access)

    -   For questions related to **lecture contents and assignments**, book with Wei
    -   For questions regarding **R programming** (such as R codes used in class, general R troubleshooting), book with our TAs

## About R Programming

-   **Please bring your laptops in all classes.** There will be R exercises in class every week.

-   It's totally normal to feel overwhelmed in the first few weeks from learning R.

-   If you run into any problems with R

    -   ["Common R Programming Errors Faced by Beginners"](https://weim-mkt.github.io/UCLMarketingAnalytics/R-errors.html); I will constantly update this page based on your questions, so this should be the first place to look for an answer
    -   Google and ChatGPT are always your best places to seek answers for most debugging issues
    -   Office hours with TAs

## Classroom Etiquette

-   **Class participation**
    -   Please remember to bring you name tags. Please let me know how to pronounce your name correctly.
-   **Attendance**
    -   School will track your attendance per university policy
    -   Please email me if you couldn't attend a class

## 10-week Contract between Us

    -   I will teach you the "science" part of marketing including the state-of-the-art marketing analytics tools

    -   Give you a way of thinking about how to use data analytics tools to solve business problems in the future, not just marketing, not just today
    -   Accessible when you need help
-   **You promise**
