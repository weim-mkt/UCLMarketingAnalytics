# Data Cleaning

## Missing Values

- In R, missing values are represented by the symbol `NA` (i.e., not available).

- Most statistical models cannot handle missing values, so we need to deal with them in R.

- If there are just a few missing values: remove them from analysis.

- If there are many missing values: need to replace them with appropriate values:
    - mean/median/imputation

## Outliers

-  **Outliers** are data points that are significantly different from other data points in the dataset, such as unusually large and small values.

-  **Winsorization** is a common method to deal with outliers. It replaces the extreme values with the nearest non-extreme value, usually the 99th or 1th percentile (or other thresholds as appropriate).

# Descriptive Analytics

```{r}
#| echo: false
pacman::p_load(dplyr, modelsummary)

data_full <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2q7ppqtyca0pd3j486osl/data_full.csv?rlkey=gsyk51q27vd1skek4qpn5ikgm&dl=1")

```

## Two Major Tasks of Descriptive Analytics

-   You can think of descriptive analytics as **creating a dashboard** to display the key information you would like to know for your business. For instance:

1. Describe data depending on your business purposes
    -   "How much do our customers spend each month on average?"
    -   "What percentage of our customers are unprofitable?"
    -   "What is the difference between the retention rates across different demographic groups?"

2. Conduct statistical tests (such as t-tests) for hypothesis testing.
    - Is there any significant difference in the average spending between different age/gender groups?
    - Based on our test mailing, can we conclude that ad-copy A works better than ad-copy B?

## Example of Descriptive Analytics Dashboard

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: 'center'
#| out-width: 9cm
knitr::include_graphics('images/Week 3/YoutubeStudio.png')
```

## Summary Statistics

-   **Summary statistics** are used to summarize a set of observations, in order to communicate the largest amount of information as simply as possible.

-   There are two main types of summary statistics used in evaluation:

    -   **measures of central tendency**: number of observations, mean, min, 25 percentile, median, 75 percentile, max, etc.

    -   **measures of dispersion:** range and standard deviation.

-   It's important to include summary statistics table in your dissertation before any statistical analysis!

## Summary Statistics with R

-   In R, a power package to report summary statistics is called `modelsummary`.

-   `datasummary_skim()` is a shortcut to conduct basic summary statistics

-   For more features, refer to the package tutorial [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/datasummary.html)

# M&S Descriptive Analytics

Let's move on to the Quarto document to see how we can apply the descriptive analytics to the M&S dataset.
