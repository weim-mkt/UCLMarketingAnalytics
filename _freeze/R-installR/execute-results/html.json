Go to R's official website in this [link](https://www.r-project.org)\n\n2. Click `CRAN` under download section\n\n![](images/R homepage.png)\n\n3. These are different mirrors for R download. Basically they store the same installation files but on different servers in different places. Simply click into any mirror.\n\n![](images/R mirror.png)\n\n4. Click into `download R for Windows` for installation files for Windows computers \n\n![](images/R download.png)\n\n5. Download and install (1) `base` and (2) `Rtools`. It's recommended to use the default options during the installations.\n    - Notes: The former is the R program, and the latter is the tool to compile R packages.\n\n![](images/R windows.png)\n\n# For Mac computers\n\n1. Go to R's official website in this [link](https://www.r-project.org)\n\n2. Click CRAN under download section\n\n![](images/R homepage.png)\n\n3. These are different mirrors for R download. Basically they store the same installation files but on different servers in different places. Simply click into any mirror.\n\n![](images/R mirror.png)\n\n4. Click into `download R for macOS` for the download file\n\n![](images/R download.png)\n\n5. Download the correct pkg file to install R\n    - if you use Intel based CPU, download the `R-4.2.1.pkg`\n    - if you use Apple's silicon chip such as M1, M1 pro, or M2, download the `R-4.2.1-arm64.pkg`\n    - refer to this [link](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211814) if you don't know how to check Intel or Apple CPU\n\n![](images/R macos.png)\n    \n    \n6. Install `Command Line Tools` following the steps below. This is essential for R to be able to compile packages so do not skip this step.\n    1. Open `terminal` app on your mac (the icon is in the screenshot)  \n![](images/R terminal.png)    \n    2. Type the following code `xcode-select --install` into terminal and hit `enter` to run the code. The code may run for a few minutes. This step is to install MacOS tools that can help compile R packages.\n![](images/R commandline tools.png)\n\n    \n# Installation Q&As\n\n## Why do we need to install `Rtools` and `Commandline tools`?\n\nMany R packages are written in R. Since R is an interpreted language, source code written in R doesn't have to be translated into system-specific machine language before running. However, some R packages have significant portions written in compiled languages, such as C/C++ or Fortran. These languages need accessory software tools to translate (\"compile\") their source code into machine language that can run on a particular system.\n\nPackage developers have two choices when distributing code for compiled languages: \n\n\n(1) They can prepare compiled, realdy-to-use \"binaries\" matched against common systems, so that people can simply download the binaries and directly use their packages code without having to know how to compile it.\n\n(2) They can distribute source code (i.e., the raw C++ codes) only, and expect the user to have the right compiler software to build system-specific runnable code themselves. `Rtools` and `Commandline tools` are the compliers that do the job, therefore needed as an additional installation step.\n\n\nOn UNIX/Linux, only source code is distributed and all packages are compiled from source during installation (for packages written entirely in R, this is trivial!). For Windows and Mac, CRAN makes pre-compiled binaries available. On Windows, install.packages() will only install precompiled binaries, unless explicitly forced to install from source (you can read a lot more about this in the R Installation and Administration guide).\n",
