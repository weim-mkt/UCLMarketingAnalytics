# Causal Inference with OLS

## Causal Effect from Linear Regression Models

-   ***Task***: Tesco would like to understand the causal impact of customer $Income$ on customer $Spending$

```{r}
#| echo: false
pacman::p_load(dplyr,ggplot2,ggthemes)
# Load both datasets
data_purchase <- read.csv(file = "https://www.dropbox.com/s/126e9vkq80y9ti9/purchase.csv?dl=1", 
                      header = T)

data_demo <- read.csv("https://www.dropbox.com/s/hbrgktcz98y0igs/demographics.csv?dl=1",
                      header = T)

# Left join demographic data into purchase data
data_full <- data_purchase %>%
  left_join(data_demo, by = "ID")

# Handle Missing Values of Income
data_full <- data_full %>%
  mutate(Income = replace(Income, is.na(Income), mean(Income,na.rm =T))) %>%
  mutate(total_spending = MntFishProducts + MntFruits + MntGoldProds + MntMeatProducts + MntSweetProducts + MntWines)
```

-   Please run the two regressions on your laptop:

    -   Regression 1: $Spending$ \~ $Income$

    -   Regression 2: $Spending$ \~ $Income$ + $Kidhome$

## Regression Results

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
pacman::p_load(fixest,modelsummary)

regression1 <- feols(data = data_full,
     fml = total_spending ~ Income ) 

regression2 <- feols(data = data_full,
     fml = total_spending ~ Income + Kidhome) 



modelsummary(list(regression1,regression2),
             stars = TRUE)
```

     fml = total_spending ~ Income + Kidhome) 



modelsummary(list(regression1,regression2),
             stars = TRUE)

-   ***Question***: if we want to evaluate income's causal effect on spending, which value (0.022, 0.019) should we use?

## Causal Inference from Regression Models

-   To obtain causal inference, we need to obtain the **direct effects** of an $X$ variable on the outcome variable $Y$.

-   **Total effects** include both direct effects and indirect effects (i.e., the impacts of other confounding variables).

-   Therefore, it is important to include **all confounding variables**, which affect income and total spending at the same time, to control for the side effects from other variables.

## Practical Suggestions for Running Regression Models

-   For causal inference tasks, we need to use business senses to decide which confounding variables to control, but the safest way is to include everything we have in the data.

-   Sometimes, control variables may be statistically insignificant, they should **NOT** be removed because they still serve the purpose of control variables.

-   If some variables are mechanically correlated, then we should not put all of them in the regression, to avoid perfect collinearity problems.

\

> Question: what is the best you can do with `data_full` to estimate the causal effect of income on spending?

## Causal Inference from Regressions

Now we have included `Kidhome` to tease out the effect of kids, what problems do we still have which hinder us from getting causal effect of income on total spending?

-   Due to data availability, we are never able to include all confounding variables in the regression.
-   Strictly speaking, we can **never obtain causal effects from simple regression models** based on **non-experiment data**.
-   Mathematically speaking, because we can never control all confounding factors, the error term is very likely to be correlated with income, violating $E[\epsilon|X] = 0$.

## RCTs and Causal Inference

-   Why RCTs are the gold standard for causal inference?
    -   If we are able to randomize people into different income groups, we can then collect the `total_spending` for each individual in each `income` group.
    -   We can run a linear regression to examine the impact of `income` on `total_spending`.

$$
Spending = \beta_0 + \beta_1Income + \epsilon
$$

-   In the above regression
    -   Are there still any confounding effects?
    -   Is $Income$ correlated with any of the confounding effects?

# Endogeneity and Its Causes

## Endogeneity

::: block
### Endogeneity

Endogeneity refers to an econometric issue with OLS linear regression, in which an explanatory variable is correlated with the error term, such that the requirement for OLS linear regression $E[\epsilon|X] = 0$ is violated.
:::

## Cause I: Omitted Variable Bias

::: block
### Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)

An omitted variable is a determinant of the outcome variable $y_i$ that is correlated with the focal explanatory variable $x_i$, but is not included in the regression, either due to data unavailability or ignorance of data scientists.
:::

Two conditions for omitted variable bias

-   The variable affects the dependent variable.
-   The variable is correlated with the focal explanatory variable.

## Examples of OVB

-  If we would like to understand the causal effect of years in education on a person's salary.

$$
Salary_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Education_t + \epsilon_t
$$

- Can we get causal effect from this regression? What would be the issue here?


## Examples of OVB

-   When building Marketing Mix Modeling, the common practice in the industry is to regress the sales in each period on the price in each period.

$$
Sales_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Price_t + \epsilon_t
$$

-  However, is this regression correct?
    - Very often, if we regress sales on price, we get a positive coefficient for price.

## Cause II: Reverse Causality (Simultaneity)

::: block
### Reverse Causality

Reverse causality refers to the phenomenon that the independent variable $X_i$ affects the dependent variable $y_i$ and the dependent variable $y_i$ also affects the independent variable $X_i$ at the same time.
:::

![](images/class9_ReverseCausality.png){fig-align="center" width="117"}

## Examples of Reverse Causality (Simultaneity)

-   Besides potential omitted variable biases, there may also exist reverse causality problems with marketing mix modelling.

$$
Sales_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Price_t + \epsilon_t
$$

-   Price affects demand, and demand affects sellers' price setting decisions.
    - Higher price leads to lower sales. (X => Y)
    - If sellers expect higher demand, sellers may increase the price to increase profits. (Y => X)

## Examples of Reverse Causality (Simultaneity)

-   UberEat interview question: If we have historical data on **number of restaurants on UberEat** in each month, and **the total number of orders in each month**, can we run an OLS regression to get the causal effect?

$$
NumOrders_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 NumRestaurants_t + \epsilon_t
$$

-   If not, how can we measure the causal effects for UberEat?

- This question is not just limited to UberEat; it is in fact related to any platform business with network effect!
    - Amazon; Airbnb; Uber Ridesharing; etc.

## Main Takeaway

-   Common threats to causal inference from secondary data include

    -   Omitted Variable Bias

    -   Reverse Causality

-   We can overcome the endogeneity problem using **instrumental variable method**.
